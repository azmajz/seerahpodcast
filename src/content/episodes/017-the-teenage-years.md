summary: "This episode explores the **formative teenage years** of the Prophet Muhammad (saw), highlighting the concept of **Ismatul Anbiya**—the divine protection of Prophets from *reprehensible behaviour*. It details how Allah physically and spiritually intervened to preserve his **modesty** and *pristine character* amidst a society where peer pressure and rowdy social gatherings were the norm. The discussion also covers his transition into **shepherding** to financially support his uncle Abu Talib and his early **natural aversion** to the worship of idols. Ultimately, he matured into the most *exemplary man* in his community, known universally as **Al-Amin**."
highlights:
  - "Ismatul Anbiya: Prophets are divinely protected from bad behaviours to preserve the purity of their Message."
  - "Physical Modesty: On two occasions, Allah intervened—once by a physical slap and once by causing him to collapse—to prevent the Prophet from exposing himself while carrying heavy rocks."
  - "Economic Responsibility: Despite his elite Qurayshi lineage, Muhammad took up shepherding to help his uncle Abu Talib with financial difficulties."
  - "Preservation from Indecency: On two separate nights, the Prophet fell into a deep sleep just outside a rowdy party, waking only when the sun rose, thus avoiding inappropriate entertainment."
  - "Natural Aversion to Shirk: Even as a youth, he prevented his adopted son Zayd from touching idols and expressed a deep hatred for swearing by Allat and Al-Uzza."
  - "Al-Amin: He became the most truthful and trustworthy man in Makkah, earning a reputation that put others to shame."

### 1. Ismatul Anbiya: The Divine Protection of Character
The Prophets and Messengers of Allah are protected by **Ismatul Anbiya**, a divine safeguard that prevents them from falling into *reprehensible behaviour*. This protection ensures the **sanctity and purity** of their Message. While ancient Arabic poetry often speaks of the *insanity or loss of sense* associated with youth, Muhammad (saw) was preserved from such impulses. Occasional "questionable" behaviours recorded for other Prophets, such as **Musa (as)** killing a man or Muhammad (saw) showing annoyance to the blind Sahabi, were **divinely decreed** to teach specific legal or moral lessons to the Ummah.

### 2. Divine Preservation of Physical Modesty
As a young boy, Muhammad (saw) was once playing a game with heavy rocks. While other boys used their **lower garments (izaar)** as knapsacks to carry stones—leaving their lower bodies exposed—Muhammad felt *uncomfortable* doing so. Under peer pressure, he began to remove his garment, but he felt a **hard slap** on the back of his head and heard a voice command him to **put his izaar back on**. A similar incident occurred in his mid-teens during the **renovations of the Ka’bah**. When he attempted to use his garment to cushion a heavy brick at his uncle Al-Abbas's suggestion, he **collapsed** and stared into the sky until he recovered, declaring that he had been **forbidden from exposing his body** in public.

### 3. Financial Responsibility and Shepherding
Muhammad (saw) was deeply aware of his uncle Abu Talib’s **financial difficulties** and sought to help. However, as a member of the elite **Banu Hashim** clan, menial labour was typically looked down upon. Additionally, Abu Talib refused to let him travel for international trade due to the **warnings from Bahira the Monk**. Consequently, Muhammad took up **shepherding**, the only acceptable work for a high-status youth that also fostered essential leadership qualities like **patience, gentleness, and alertness**. Through this work, he was able to provide meaningful financial support to his family.

### 4. Miraculous Avoidance of Social Indecency
During his teenage years, other young shepherds would often pressure Muhammad to attend **rowdy parties** featuring alcohol and singing. Though he was naturally **straight-laced and decent**, he once made arrangements for another shepherd to cover his shift so he could satisfy his curiosity. However, as he reached the outskirts of the party, he **suddenly passed out** and did not wake until the sun hit his face the next morning. When he tried to attend again the following night, the same **miraculous sleep** overcame him. Later, the Prophet swore that he never had the desire to indulge in such scenes again until **Allah blessed him with Prophethood**.

### 5. Natural Aversion to Shirk and Idolatry
From an early age, Allah instilled in Muhammad a **natural hesitation** for shirk (associating partners with Allah). While performing *tawaaf* around the Ka'bah, his adopted son **Zayd bin Haritha** attempted to imitate the pagans by rubbing his hand on a copper idol. Muhammad **pulled Zayd’s hand away** and strictly forbade him from touching it. Furthermore, whenever people asked him to take an oath by the prominent idols **Allat and Al-Uzza**, he would refuse, stating there was **nothing he hated more** than those two things.

### 6. Maturing into Al-Sadiq Al-Amin
As he matured into a man, Allah set a **boundary of protection** around him from the customs of the *Jahiliya* (ignorance). He became the **most virtuous and exemplary man** in his community, known for having the most excellent company and **great forbearance**. His reputation for being the **most truthful person** was so widespread that he was universally known by the title **Al-Amin** (The Trustworthy). Even those who did not know his name recognised him by this title because of his **impeccable character** that put other men to shame.
