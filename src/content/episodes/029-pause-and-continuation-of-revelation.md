### 1. Early Revelations: Al-Qalam and Al-Muzzammil
According to the sources, some scholars believe that shortly after the talk with Waraqah, the Prophet received his second revelation: the opening of **Surat Al-Qalam**. This revelation used the disjointed letter *Noon* to catch the listener's attention and reassured the Prophet that he was not a madman, but rather possessed **great moral character**. 

A third revelation, from **Surat Al-Muzzammil**, followed quickly thereafter. It commanded the Prophet to **pray during the night** and warned him that a **'heavy word'** would be cast upon him. The night prayers were intended to 'recharge his spiritual batteries' and prepare him for the immense responsibilities ahead.

### 2. Fatrat al-Wahi: The Pause in Revelation
Following these initial messages, the Prophet experienced **Fatrat al-Wahi**, a break in revelation. The exact duration of this pause is debated; some scholars suggest it lasted **three years**, while others believe it was only a few days or weeks. The purpose of this break was to give the Prophet time to **acclimate** to the overwhelming experience of receiving the Word of Allah and being squeezed by an angel, which the sources describe as potentially traumatic.

### 3. The Prophet’s Anxiety and the Mountain
Once the initial shock subsided, the Prophet began to **long for revelation** again. As the silence continued, he was gripped by **severe anxiety**, worrying that he had failed to live up to expectations or that Allah was angry with him. 

In this state of confusion, he climbed the mountain with thoughts that if Allah were upset, he would throw himself off. The sources clarify that this was an expression of **extreme emotional distress** and a desire to please his Lord, rather than a modern concept of a psychological disorder. Jibril eventually appeared to him on the mountain, confirming, **'You are indeed the Messenger of Allah,'** which calmed his nerves.

### 4. Jibril’s True Form and the Call to Action
A few days later, while walking in the Makkah marketplace, the Prophet heard a sound and looked up to see Jibril for the **second time in his true physical form**. Jibril was sitting on a throne and appeared as immense as before. Shaken to his core, the Prophet returned home and asked Khadijah to wrap him in a blanket. 

At this moment, revelation returned (from **Surat Al-Muddatthir**, though the source notes it as similar to Al-Muzzammil), commanding him: **'Stand up and warn'**. He was told to proclaim the greatness of his Lord, purify himself, and leave all evil things. The term for 'warn' (*Indhaar*) implies warning someone out of **love and concern**. This marked the moment the Prophet became a **man on a mission**.

### 5. Divine Reassurance: Surat Ad-Duhaa
Sometime later, the Prophet became ill and did not receive revelation for two or three nights. An idol-worshipping woman mocked him, claiming that his **'buddy' (Allah) or 'shaytan' had abandoned him**. In response, Allah revealed **Surat Ad-Duhaa**, declaring: **'Your Lord has not abandoned you, nor is your Lord upset with you'**. This served as a final, beautiful reassurance of Allah’s continued support.
