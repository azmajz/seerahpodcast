summary: "This episode explores the escalating political and social tension in Makkah following the public conversion of **Umar ibn al-Khattab**. It details the shift to open prayer at the Ka’bah, the **Quraysh's failed 'blank check' negotiations**, and the subsequent unreasonable demands for miracles. The narrative culminates in **Abu Jahl’s failed assassination attempt**, thwarted by a miraculous intervention, and Allah’s definitive promise of physical protection for the Prophet (saw)."
highlights:
  - "In the Quran, masculine tenses serve as a universal address for both men and women, unless a specific female focus is required."
  - "The presence of Hamza and Umar allowed the Muslims to move from Darul Arqam to praying openly at the Ka’bah for the first time."
  - "The Quraysh offered the Prophet a 'blank check' of wealth and leadership if he would recognise their idols as legitimate."
  - "Quraysh leaders demanded the Prophet turn the desert into lush greenery or resurrect their ancestor Qusai bin Kilab as proof of his message."
  - "Abu Jahl attempted to smash the Prophet's head with a rock during prayer but was stopped by the vision of a terrifying 'demon camel'."
  - "The 'demon camel' was identified by the Prophet as the Angel Jibril, his 'prayer buddy' and heavenly minister."

### 1. Gender Tenses in the Quran
The sources clarify the linguistic structure of the Quran regarding gender: when Allah addresses humans in the **masculine tense**, it is a **universal address** to all of humanity. Specific mentions of "men and women" (as seen in Surahs like An-Nisa or Al-Ahzab) occur only when women are the special focus of a verse. This distinction arose after the women of the Sahaba asked the Prophet why they were not specifically named; Allah responded by revealing verses that explicitly called upon both **Believing men and Believing women**.

### 2. The Shift to Public Worship
For the first five years of his mission, the Prophet (saw) prayed openly at the Ka’bah, but he allowed other Muslims to choose their own level of public visibility. Following **Umar ibn al-Khattab’s** proposal, the community moved from the secrecy of Darul Arqam to **public prayer at the Haram**. This was made possible by **Hamza and Umar**, who stood as "enforcers" on either side of the congregation to protect the Muslims from the Quraysh, who were restrained by the political status of these two men.

### 3. The Council of Quraysh and the "Blank Check"
The sudden visibility of the Muslims triggered a council meeting of Makkah’s elite, including **Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan, and Walid ibn Mughira**. Frustrated by the success of the migration to Abyssinia and the failure of their smear campaigns, they offered the Prophet a **"blank check"**. They promised him:
*   **Unlimited wealth** for the rest of his life.
*   **Leadership**, making him the head of the council of Quraysh.
*   **Legitimacy**, provided he recognise their idols as valid.

The Prophet rejected these offers, presenting only the **Quran** as his counter-offer. He also refused a "trade" proposal where the two groups would take turns worshipping each other’s God on alternating days.

### 4. Unreasonable Demands for Miracles
When negotiations failed, the Quraysh became irrational. They demanded that the Prophet prove his status by **moving the mountains** and making Makkah lush and green like Iraq or Syria. They even challenged him to **resurrect their ancestor Qusai bin Kilab** to testify for him. When the Prophet remained steadfast, the leaders lashed out with insults, claiming he was learning his words from a man in Yamama or demanding he appear with a physical **army of angels**.

### 5. Abu Jahl’s Attempted Assassination
Infuriated by the failed diplomacy, **Abu Jahl** vowed to the council that he would kill the Prophet. He promised to smash the Prophet’s head with a **massive rock** while he was in prostration (*sujood*). However, as he approached the praying Prophet, Abu Jahl suddenly went pale and retreated in terror. 

He later claimed he saw a **huge, ferocious "demon camel"** with sharp teeth that towered over the Prophet, ready to crush Abu Jahl if he stepped closer. The Prophet later smiled and identified this creature as **Jibril**, whom he described as his "friend" and "prayer buddy".

### 6. Divine Guarantee of Safety
Following this attempt on his life, Allah revealed a verse from **Surat al-Ma’idah** (5:67), commanding the Prophet to deliver the message to its full extent. Allah provided a definitive promise: **"Allah will completely protect you from the people"**. This established that regardless of the repercussions or plots of the disbelievers, the Prophet’s physical safety was divinely secured.
