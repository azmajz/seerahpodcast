summary: "This episode examines the **spiritual deterioration** of pre-Islamic Arabia, focusing on how **idolatry** was first introduced to Makkah by *Amr ibn Luhay*. It details the transition from **pure monotheism** to a system of *intermediaries*, where over 360 idols were eventually placed around the Ka’bah. The discussion highlights *superstitious practices* involving livestock, the **corruption of previous scriptures**, and how the Quraysh *exploited* the sacredness of Makkah for profit. Ultimately, it illustrates a society where religion had become **symbolic and ceremonial**, often a subject of mockery until the Prophet (saw) arrived as a *nadhir* (warner) to restore **sincere guidance**."
highlights:
  - "The Prophet was sent as a nadhir (warner) to provide compassionate warning to a people who had been without spiritual guidance for generations."
  - "Amr ibn Luhay, a cultured traveller, introduced the first idol (Hubal) from Syria and was later led by a jinn to uncover five idols from Nuh’s (as) time."
  - "Pagan Arabs still believed in Allah's supremacy but viewed idols as secondary dignitaries or intermediaries to reach Him."
  - "The Quraysh exploited pilgrims by forcing them to buy expensive clothing; those who couldn't afford it were forced to perform Hajj naked."
  - "Innovative livestock practices like Bahirah and Sa’ibah designated specific camels solely for the idols, making them off-limits for human use."
  - "The Prophet was mocked as 'Ibn Abi Kabsha' because he, like a previous social outcast, challenged the established idol worship of the Quraysh."
  - "Religion was marginalized to the point that tribes would 'delay' sacred months to continue fighting their wars without interruption."

### 1. The Introduction of Idolatry via Amr ibn Luhay
The transition from **monotheism** to **paganism** in Makkah began with *Amr ibn Luhay*, a leader of the Khuz’ai tribe and a cultured traveller. While visiting Syria, he observed people worshipping idols and brought the moon god, **Hubal**, back to Makkah, encouraging others to follow suit. A hadith in Bukhari further notes that a *jinn* led Amr to Jeddah, where he uncovered five idols—**Wadd, Suwa, Yaghuts, Ya’uq, and Nasr**—which were the same ones worshipped during the time of Nuh (as). Because Amr was a respected figure, the Makkans accepted these idols, leading to a **widespread spiritual deterioration** where paganism became the predominant form of spirituality.

### 2. Idols as Intermediaries and Satellite Sanctuaries
The pagan Arabs did not reject the **supremacy of Allah**; rather, they viewed idols as **intermediaries** or *protectors* meant to bring them nearer to Allah. Each tribe adopted specific idols; for instance, **Banu Kalb** worshipped Wadd, while **Banu Hudhayl** worshipped Suwa. To replicate the prestige of the Ka'bah, tribes built **satellite sanctuaries** or "mini-Ka’bahs" for their second-tier gods, such as **Al-Lat** in Ta’if and **Manat** in Yathrib. By the time of the Conquest of Makkah, there were over **360 idols** in and around the Ka’bah, and many people even kept idols within their private homes.

### 3. Superstitions and Innovative Camel Practices
Spiritual perversion led to the invention of **superstitious innovations** regarding livestock, which Allah later refuted in *Surat al-Ma’idah*. These practices included **Bahirah** (milk from a she-camel designated only for idols), **Sa’ibah** (a she-camel set free to roam without being used for food or transport), and **Wasilah**. Additionally, **Ham** referred to a male camel used strictly for breeding for the "gods". Beyond livestock, the Arabs relied on **gambling with arrows** or observing the flight patterns of **birds** to make major life decisions. The crow (*ghurab*) was particularly feared as an **evil omen** of death.

### 4. Distorted Monotheism: Christianity and Judaism
By the time of the Prophet (saw), the original messages of **Christianity and Judaism** had become perverted in the region. Judaism was often dominated by **rabbinical law** rather than the Tawrah, and many Christians had fallen into the **predicament of worshipping Isa (as)** and believing in the **Trinity**. While these groups existed in the Hijaz, they were **minorities** who lived in isolation and did not actively seek converts, leaving the majority of the population in a state of **spiritual darkness**.

### 5. Abu Kabsha and the Accusation of Astrology
While astrology never fully caught on in Arabia, a man named **Abu Kabsha** attempted to introduce the worship of the star **Shiya’ra (Sirius)** after travelling abroad. The Makkans dismissed him as a **crazy person** for abandoning their traditional idols. When the Prophet (saw) began his mission, the Quraysh mocked him as **"Ibn Abi Kabsha,"** comparing him to the outcast who also tried to stop their idol worship. Allah refuted this in *Surat An-Najm* by clarifying that He is the **Rabb (Lord) of Shiya’ra**, and the Prophet was calling them to worship the *Creator* of the star, not the star itself.

### 6. Exploitation and the Mockery of Religion
The Quraysh maintained a **monopoly on the Ka’bah**, using it to exert **political and economic control**. They viewed anyone outside their tribe as "filthy" and forced pilgrims to **purchase expensive Qurayshi clothing** to perform Hajj; those who could not afford it were forced to perform the pilgrimage **naked**. Furthermore, they would **manipulate the sacred months**—a practice called *postponing*—to allow their wars to continue without pausing for holy restrictions. Religion became so **marginalised** that some tribes, like the Banu Hanifa, even made an idol out of **cake (halwa)**, only to **eat it** when a drought caused starvation.
