summary: "This episode explores the **Hilf al-Fudul** (League of the Virtuous), a landmark **social justice pact** formed in Makkah when the Prophet Muhammad (saw) was approximately **19 to 20 years old**. The pact was triggered by a **deceitful business transaction** where a Qurayshi leader, Al-Aas bin Wa-il, refused to pay an outsider for his merchandise. This led to a **pivotal meeting** of tribal leaders who pledged to **oppose oppression** and support the rights of the vulnerable, regardless of tribal affiliation. The Prophet later expressed **immense pride** in this pre-Islamic agreement, stating that it aligned perfectly with the **universal ethics** of Islam."
highlights:
  - "The Prophet was a young man of 19 or 20 when the pact was formed, shortly after the end of the Sacrilegious War."
  - "Al-Aas bin Wa-il, a prominent Qurayshi, exploited a Yemeni businessman by refusing to pay for delivered goods."
  - "The victim resorted to a desperate public protest at the Ka’bah, calling out the 'men of honour' for their deceit."
  - "The pact was named either after three men named Al-Fadal or for its 'virtuous' nature (*fudul*)."
  - "Leaders from two dozen tribes used the threat of force to compel Al-Aas to return the stolen merchandise."
  - "Prophet Muhammad (saw) famously remarked that he wouldn’t trade his presence at the pact for 'red she-camels' (the Ferraris of that era)."
  - "Hussain ibn Ali later invoked the pact decades after the Prophet’s death to successfully demand his rights from the Governor of Madinah."

### 1. The Catalyst: A Breach of Trust in Makkah
Shortly after the **Sacrilegious War** had ended, the Quraysh were still grappling with the memory of how **tribal injustice** could lead to total conflict. A man from the **Zubayd** tribe in Yemen arrived in Makkah for business and agreed to sell merchandise to a local leader named **Al-Aas bin Wa-il**. Although the Quraysh were generally regarded as **honest caretakers** of the Haram, Al-Aas refused to pay the man the following day, effectively **exploiting his status** as a local against a vulnerable outsider. When the Zubaydi man sought help from other Qurayshi leaders, they dismissed him, adhering to the *traditional custom* where **tribal loyalty** outweighed truth and justice.

### 2. A Desperate Protest at the Sacred House
Feeling distraught and unable to support his family, the Zubaydi man took a **drastic step** during sunrise when the leaders congregated at the Ka’bah. He **removed his shirt**—a cultural sign of *extreme desperation*—and stood before the door of the Ka’bah to call out the people of **dignity and honour**. He questioned how such **deceit and dishonesty** could exist within the heart of a city meant to be a **sanctuary** for worship and safety. His public shaming of the leaders was the catalyst for action, with the Prophet's uncle, **Az-Zubayr bin Abdul Muttalib**, being the first to stand and sympathise with the man's plight.

### 3. The Hilf al-Fudul: Defining the League of Virtue
Determined to avoid the type of unrest that had sparked the recent five-year war, the leaders gathered at the home of **Abdullah bin Jada’an** to form a formal agreement. They established a pact known as **Hilf al-Fudul**, which pledged to **support the rights of all oppressed people**, including outsiders, and to **oppose any oppressor**, even if they were from the Quraysh. The sources offer two explanations for the name: it either referred to three men present named **Al-Fadal**, or it derived from the word *fudul*, meaning **virtue**. Effectively, they pledged to collectively **intervene in conflicts** to establish justice.

### 4. Enforcing the Pact through Strength
The newfound alliance was immediately put to the test when two dozen **powerful leaders** confronted Al-Aas bin Wa-il at his home. When Al-Aas attempted to argue that they should **overlook his actions** due to tribal ties, the leaders informed him that the "scratch my back, I scratch yours" mentality was **no longer acceptable**. Facing the threat of **swords**, Al-Aas was forced to return the merchandise. The Quraysh then **formally apologised** to the Zubaydi man on behalf of the tribe, marking a significant shift toward **principled justice** over blind tribalism.

### 5. The Prophet’s Enduring Pride in the Alliance
During the later Madinan period of his Prophethood, Muhammad (saw) reflected on witnessing this pact at the age of 20 with **profound respect**. He stated that he would not trade his presence at that meeting for **red she-camels**—which the sources liken to modern-day **Ferraris** or the most valuable material goods. He further asserted that if he were called to participate in such an oath today under **Islam and Shari’ah**, he would still go. His pride stemmed from the fact that the pact was built on **social justice and ethics**, even though it was conceived by idol-worshippers during the era of ignorance.

### 6. Legacy: The Sahaba and the Calling of the Pact
The **Hilf al-Fudul** remained a valid legal and moral tool long after the Prophet’s passing. A significant instance occurred when **Hussain ibn Ali** (the Prophet's grandson) had a financial dispute with **Walid**, the Governor of Madinah, who was using his **political weight** to avoid payment. Hussain threatened to stand in the Prophet’s Masjid and **call for the Hilf al-Fudul**. Upon hearing this, other prominent Sahaba and their children, including **Abdullah bin Zubayr**, vowed to draw their swords and stand with Hussain to uphold the **virtue of that oath**. Realising the gravity of the situation, Walid immediately **fulfilled his obligation**.

### 7. Principles of Universal Ethics in Islam
According to the sources, thinkers like **Tariq Ramadan** derive three core principles from this historical event:
*   **External Values:** Islam embraces righteous values derived from the **human conscience**, even those originating outside the Islamic tradition.
*   **Non-Muslim Righteousness:** The faith acknowledges that **non-Muslims** can and do defend justice and the oppressed.
*   **Universal Allegiance:** Instead of fostering a closed community, Islam requires **allegiance to universal principles** of justice that are not in conflict with other moral value systems.
