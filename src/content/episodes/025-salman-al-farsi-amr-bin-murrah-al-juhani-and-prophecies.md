### 1. The Miraculous Liberation of Salman al-Farsi
Although Salman al-Farsi had met the Prophet (saw) and accepted Islam, he remained a **slave**, which prevented him from participating in the battles of Badr and Uhud. To secure his freedom, the Prophet (saw) encouraged him to enter a **Kitabah al Muqataba**—a contract to buy his freedom from his owner. The owner set a steep price: planting **300 date palm trees** and providing **40 grams of gold**. 

The Prophet (saw) called upon the Sahaba to help their "brother," regardless of the fact that he was a Persian slave and they were free Arabs. The Sahaba contributed the necessary seeds and prepared the soil, but the Prophet (saw) **personally planted all 300 trees** with his own hands. In a display of his blessed status, **not a single tree died**, even though uprooting and replanting trees was a highly risky venture. Shortly after, the Prophet (saw) received a gift of gold from a newly discovered mine, which he gave to Salman; it weighed **exactly the 40 grams** required. From that day, Salman was a free man.

### 2. Salman: "From the Family of the Prophet"
Salman’s first military engagement was the **Battle of the Trench (Gazwah al-Khandaq)**, where he suggested the strategy of digging a trench to defend Madinah. When the Prophet (saw) divided the warriors into groups of ten by family to dig, a dispute arose between the **Muhajiroon** (Emigrants from Makkah) and the **Ansar** (Helpers from Madinah). Both groups claimed Salman as one of their own. The Prophet (saw) settled the matter by declaring: **"Salman is going to dig the trench with my family,"** effectively making the Persian former slave a member of his own household.

### 3. Amr bin Murrah al-Juhani and the Light from the Ka’bah
Amr bin Murrah al-Juhani, a respected member of the pre-Islamic community, experienced a **divine vision** while in Makkah. He saw a **noor (light)** shooting out from the Ka’bah toward the mountains and heard a voice announcing that darkness was about to be removed and the **Final Seal of the Prophet** was being sent. A monk later confirmed to Amr that this light signaled the arrival of a Prophet named **Ahmad**.

Years later, upon meeting the Prophet (saw) and confirming his mission, Amr took the **Shahadah**. He returned to his people, broke their idols, and preached the message of Islam. The Prophet (saw) provided him with essential advice for dawah: to be **soft, gentle, respectful, and honest**, and to avoid being harsh, arrogant, or jealous. Consequently, almost his entire tribe accepted Islam.

### 4. Supernatural Signs of a Changing World
The sources describe several extraordinary events that occurred as the doors of **revelation opened** after a 600-year gap.
*   **The Speaking Sacrifice:** Umar ibn al-Khattab recalled a soothsayer witnessing a **dead, sacrificed goat** speak with a terrifying voice, announcing the arrival of "La ilaha illallah".
*   **Hopelessness of the Jinn:** A soothsayer reported that the **shayatin (jinn)** had become hopeless because they could no longer access the heavenly information they previously used to deceive people. The spiritual "world was starting to change" because of the coming message.

### 5. The Philosophy of Divine Guidance
The sources emphasize that while humans act as the **"means"** in sharing the message, it is **Allah directly who guides** hearts. Shaykh Abdul Nasir Jangda shares a modern story of a friend in Texas who saw a dream of someone performing **salaah** months before even knowing what Islam was, illustrating that guidance can occur without any human intervention. The Prophet (saw) used to smile and become excited when hearing such stories, as they serve as a reminder that we are merely "cogs in the machine" and that **all credit for guidance belongs to Allah**.
