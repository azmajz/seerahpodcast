### 1. The Shaking of the Persian Empire
The birth of the Prophet (saw) was marked by **cataclysmic events** in the Persian Empire, foretelling the end of their long-standing rule. On that night, the **Palace of Qisra** literally shook, causing **14 balconies** to break and fall off. Simultaneously, the **sacred fire** of the Zoroastrians, which had been burning continuously for a **thousand years**, was suddenly extinguished. Further signs included the **Tigris River** dropping to such low levels that irrigation failed to reach farms. A high-ranking minister named **Mubidaan** dreamed of a *large older camel* outrunning a *young fast horse*, which he interpreted as something significant occurring in the **direction of the Arabs**.

### 2. Scholarly Prophecies and the Coming of the Arabs
Two or three generations prior to the birth, priests from **as-Sham (Syria)** began investigating the Qureysh to identify which family would produce the final Prophet. One priest told **Abd-Munaf** (the Prophet's great-great-grandfather) that the Arabs were in a "calm before the storm". He predicted that although the Arabs were currently *illiterate and simple*, their progeny would **break idols** with their own hands and defeat the **great Persian and Roman empires** to inherit their wealth. The priest also correctly foretold that the Prophet would perform **Hijrah**, die in a blessed place (**Madinah**), and be succeeded by leaders of great **trustworthiness and honor**, specifically referencing the qualities of **Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman**.

### 3. Ayisa the Monk and the Monday Signs
A Christian monk named **Ayisa**, renowned for his knowledge of past Prophets, established a monastery outside Makkah specifically to find the final Messenger. He told the leaders of Makkah that the child would be born in their era, would **rule over non-Arabs**, and that believers would find themselves in a *strong position* while opposers would be wrong. Ayisa identified three converging markers: the appearance of a **specific star** in the sky, a birth occurring on a **Monday**, and the name **Muhammad**. He also warned that the Prophet would be **deeply envied and attacked** by his own people, advising others to guard their tongues against him.

### 4. Miracles of Infancy and the Seal of Prophethood
Shortly after birth, an **evil jinn** attempted to harm the infant Muhammad by sticking his fingers in the baby's mouth to prevent him from **nursing**. This caused the child discomfort for three days until the **Malayika (angels)** arrived, removed the jinn, and protected the Prophet so he could drink milk comfortably. Meanwhile, Jewish rabbis in **Yathrib** tearfully announced that *Nubu'a (Prophethood)* had left **Banu Israel** after seeing a light emanating from Makkah. One rabbi visited **Aminah** and confirmed the child's identity by the **Seal of Prophethood**—a birthmark resembling a *cluster of moles* with small hairs located between his shoulder blades.

### 5. Divine Legacy and the Name Ahmad
The Prophet's coming was not a new revelation but a **confirmation of past scriptures**. Isa (as) had previously given the "good news" of a messenger named **Ahmad** who would follow him, as recorded in the Quran (*Surat As-Saf*). Aminah reportedly preferred the name **Ahmad** for her son, matching the prophecies found in the **Tawrut and Injeel**. Ayisa the monk further predicted that the Prophet would not live to see 70, but would pass away in his **60s**, which would become the **average age** of his entire Ummah.
