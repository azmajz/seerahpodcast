summary: "This episode details the dramatic conversion of **Umar ibn al-Khattab**, which took place just three days after Hamza ibn Abi Talib accepted Islam. It follows Umar's journey from setting out with the intent to assassinate the Prophet (saw) to being spiritually transformed by the verses of **Surat Ta’ha**. The narrative covers his confrontation with his sister Fatima, his peaceful entry into **Darul Arqam**, his public defiance of the Quraysh at the Haram, and the first time Muslims were able to **congregate in prayer publicly** at the Ka’bah."
highlights:
  - "Umar set out with an unsheathed sword, a signal of his intent to kill the Prophet (saw) for dividing the Quraysh."
  - "Nu’aim ibn Abdullah diverted Umar by revealing that his sister Fatima and brother-in-law Sa’eed had already converted."
  - "The turning point occurred when Umar saw his sister bleeding from his blow, leading him to read the Quranic pages she was hiding."
  - "Verses from Surat Ta’ha, specifically the powerful declaration of Allah’s oneness in Ayah 14, deeply impacted Umar’s heart."
  - "Hamza (ra) offered to protect the Prophet (saw) by killing Umar with his own sword if he arrived with ill intentions."
  - "Umar fought off a mob of up to 30 people single-handedly at the Haram for an hour after publicly announcing his conversion."
  - "The conversion of Umar allowed Muslims to finally pray openly at the Ka’bah."

### 1. The Intent to Assassinate
Following the second migration to Abyssinia, Umar ibn al-Khattab overheard members of the Quraysh discussing their inability to stop the Prophet’s (saw) preaching. Declaring he would "take care of this," Umar set out with his **sword unsheathed**, a gesture that indicated immediate intent to take action. Along the way, he encountered Nu’aim ibn Abdullah, who tried to dissuade him by mentioning the potential retaliation from the Prophet's family. When Umar remained unfazed, Nu’aim revealed that Umar’s own family—his sister **Fatima** and brother-in-law **Sa’eed**—had already accepted Islam.

### 2. Confrontation and the Turning Point
Umar arrived at his sister’s house and heard the voices of Fatima, Sa’eed, and **Khabbab ibn al-Aratt** reciting the Quran. In a rage, he burst in and began beating Sa’eed; when Fatima tried to intervene, Umar struck her, causing her to bleed. Seeing his sister's blood and her unwavering defiance—challenging him to do his worst while affirming her faith—calmed Umar’s anger. He asked to see the pages they were reading, but Fatima insisted he **clean himself first**, as he was "not pure".

### 3. The Impact of Surat Ta’ha
After washing, Umar began reading the beginning of **Surah 20 (Surat Ta’ha)**. The verses described the Quran as a reminder for those who fear Allah and a revelation from the Creator of the heavens and earth. When he reached Ayah 14—*"Most definitely, me, I am Allah... there is no deity except Me, so worship Me"*—the powerful emphasis on Allah’s name and oneness deeply moved him. Umar immediately requested to be taken to the Prophet (saw) to accept Islam.

### 4. Acceptance at Darul Arqam
Umar arrived at **Darul Arqam** with his sword still tied to his side, causing the Sahaba inside to become nervous. **Hamza**, who had accepted Islam three days prior, stood up and vowed to welcome Umar if he came with good intentions, or kill him with his own sword if he intended harm. The Prophet (saw) opened the door and, recognizing Umar’s personality, **confronted him directly**, grabbing him and warning him to stop making trouble before divine punishment arrived. Umar responded softly, declaring his intent to accept Islam, prompting the Prophet and the Sahaba to yell **Takbeer** in celebration.

### 5. Public Proclamation and Defiance
Umar’s conversion was immediate and public. He first informed his mentor **Abu Jahl**, who reacted with disgust and called him a "foolish boy". The next day, after a man named Jamil ibn Ma’mar spread the news, a mob at the Haram attacked Umar for being a "heretic". Umar fought approximately **two to three dozen men** single-handedly for an hour, refusing to give up even when exhausted. The crowd only retreated when **A’as bin Wai’l**, an elder, intervened and reminded them that Umar’s family would not stand for him being murdered.

### 6. The First Public Prayer and Migration
Umar insisted that the Muslims should no longer hide and suggested a public demonstration of faith. He and Hamza led two lines of Muslims in a **march to the Ka’bah**, where they congregated in prayer publicly for the first time. Abdullah ibn Mas’ood noted that the Muslims were only able to pray at the Ka’bah because of Umar’s strength. Later, during the Hijra to Medina, while others slipped away secretly at night, Umar **openly packed his bags** and challenged anyone to meet him outside the city if they wanted to stop him.

### 7. Pre-Islamic Glimpses of Character
The sources suggest that even before his conversion, Umar possessed a hidden softness. **Ummu Abdullah**, an early convert, recalled that when she was packing for the migration to Abyssinia, a then-non-Muslim Umar saw her and said, **"May God be with you"**. She noted a sadness and contemplation in him that she had never seen before, correctly sensing that he might one day accept Islam despite her husband's scepticism.
