### 1. The Growing Presence of Islam
After the establishment of a significant Muslim presence in Makkah, the non-believers began to realise that the movement was not a passing trend. Reputable and prominent individuals had joined the ranks, and the presence of a second 'camp' of Muslims in Abyssinia provided the community with a sense of permanence. **King an-Najashi**, a devout Christian scholar and ruler, had secretly accepted Islam and provided the refugees in his kingdom with protection and a fixed stipend. Word of this influential support spread to other Christian territories, particularly in **Northern Arabia**, where the Roman-influenced Arabs decided they could no longer ignore the Prophet's claims.

### 2. The Investigation of the Twenty Men
In the **5th year of Nabua**, a tribe of Christian Arabs from An-Najd sent a delegation of **20 highly educated men** to Makkah to explore the truth about Muhammad (saw). Upon arrival, they were directed by the Quraysh leaders to the Prophet at **Darul Arqam**. The men engaged the Prophet in a thorough question-and-answer session. Impressed by his kind and accommodating nature, they accepted his request to present the message of Islam and listen to the recitation of the Quran.

### 3. Recognition and Conversion
The sources describe a profound spiritual reaction from the delegates: as the Prophet recited the Quran, their **eyes welled up with tears**. They recognised that the message and the man perfectly matched the descriptions of the final Prophet provided by their own men of Scripture. They attested to the truth of the message and accepted Islam on the spot.

### 4. Abu Jahl’s Hostility
News of the delegation's conversion spread quickly, infuriating **Abu Jahl**, who felt the Quraysh were 'losing day by day'. He intercepted the men as they were leaving Makkah and launched a vicious verbal assault. He accused them of being **unintelligent, foolish, and disloyal** to the people who had sent them, claiming they had 'stabbed their own people in the back' by abandoning their original religion so easily.

### 5. The Response of Peace
Despite Abu Jahl’s belligerence, the delegation exhibited **exceptional character**. They refused to engage in his ignorance, responding with: **\"Salamun alaykum (Peace be upon you). For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds\"**. They explained that they had intentionally sought research and found *khair* (goodness) for both this life and the hereafter, and they could not refuse something so beneficial simply to avoid being called 'foolish'.

### 6. Divine Validation: Surat al-Qasas
In response to this encounter, the Prophet (saw) received revelation from **Surat al-Qasas** (28:51-55). The verses clarified that:
*   Those who were given the Scripture before the Quran and believed in it are true believers.
*   They recognised the Quran as the truth from their Lord and identified themselves as **Muslims (submitting to Allah)** even before its revelation.
*   They would be given a **double reward** for their patience and for averting evil with good.
*   Turning away from 'ill speech' and seeking peace from the ignorant is a hallmark of their faith.

### 7. Character as a Gateway to Faith
The sources conclude that the contrast between Abu Jahl and the delegation serves as a lesson in **conduct and imaan**. While Abu Jahl’s belligerence kept him from the truth, the delegation's kindness and respectful demeanour led them to guidance. The episode highlights that exhibiting **good character and conduct** is the primary way for a believer to grow in their faith and achieve goodness.
