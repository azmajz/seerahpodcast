summary: "This episode chronicles two defining events in the legacy of **Abdul Muttalib**: the rediscovery of the **Well of Zamzam** and the beginning of the **Invasion of the Elephants**. After the well had been buried and forgotten for centuries following a civil war, Abdul Muttalib received **divine inspiration** through a series of dreams to unearth it. The episode also details the rise of **Abraha** in Yemen, who built a magnificent church to compete with the Ka’bah, ultimately leading to a **massive military expedition** against Makkah after a religious desecration sparked his fury."
highlights:
  - "Abdul Muttalib received ilham (divine inspiration) over four nights, gradually revealing the location and purity of Zamzam."
  - "The well was originally buried centuries earlier by a fleeing tribe to hide gold and silver treasures."
  - "A miraculous spring in the desert resolved a leadership dispute, confirming Abdul Muttalib’s divine mandate as the custodian of Zamzam."
  - "Zamzam water is described as a 'spiritual tool' that serves the specific intention of the person drinking it."
  - "Abraha, the strategist ruler of Yemen, built the Qullays church to divert global trade and pilgrims from Makkah."
  - "The invasion was triggered by a man from Banu Kanana who desecrated Abraha’s church, leading to a war involving 60,000 troops and 12 elephants."
  - "A key ethical lesson from the conflict is the Quranic command to respect other religions' sacred symbols to prevent retaliation against Allah."

### 1. The Lost Legacy: The Burial of Zamzam
The Well of Zamzam, originally from the legacy of **Ibrahim (as)**, had been buried for so long that it lost its significance over the centuries. Historically, during a **major civil war** for the control of Makkah, the tribe in charge buried their **gold and silver weapons** and valuables inside the well to prevent them from being recovered. They then covered the well and hid it so effectively that as decades passed, people forgot its exact location, treating it only as a **myth or legend**. Its rediscovery was a pivotal cultural event and a **sign of nearing Prophethood**.

### 2. Divine Inspiration: The Four Nights of Dreams
Abdul Muttalib received **ilham** (divine inspiration), which is distinguished from *wahi* (revelation) as it is a message given to a **pious and righteous individual**. Over four consecutive nights, an angel appeared in his dreams:
*   **Night 1:** He was told to dig up *teeba* (the appealing).
*   **Night 2:** He was told to dig up *barra* (the blessed).
*   **Night 3:** He was told to dig up *madhnoona* (the coveted).
*   **Night 4:** The angel finally named **Zamzam**, describing it as a water that **never expires**, is always abundant, and is **purified** between blood and excrement.
The angel provided specific landmarks: **ant hills** and a place where **crows would be pecking** the ground.

### 3. The Discovery and the Treasure of the Well
Following the dream's instructions, Abdul Muttalib and his son **Al-Harith** began digging and unearthed **swords of gold and silver** adorned with jewels, alongside bricks of precious coins. Upon hitting the top of the well, they shouted **Takbeer**, attracting the attention of other tribal leaders. A dispute immediately arose as the other leaders demanded a **share of the rights** to the well, claiming it belonged to their forefather **Ismail**. They eventually agreed to travel to a **soothsayer** (*kahin*) located far away to mediate the ownership.

### 4. The Desert Miracle and Confirmation of Custodianship
During the long journey to the soothsayer, the caravan ran out of water and food, leading the travellers to **dig their own graves** in anticipation of death. Abdul Muttalib, feeling they were close to a solution, encouraged them to move forward. When he kicked his animal to rise, **water sprang forth** from the ground exactly where the animal’s feet hit. Recognising this as a divine sign, the other leaders admitted that the One who showed him this water was the same One who showed him **Zamzam**, and they granted him **exclusive custodianship**.

### 5. Spiritual Value and Etiquettes of Zamzam
Abdul Muttalib solidified the well and used the discovered gold to **adorn the Ka’bah** with its first door. He treated the water as **sacred**, forbidding people from using it to wash animals or belongings. In Islam, drinking Zamzam is an **act of worship**. The Prophet (saw) stated that the water **serves the purpose** for which it is drunk. A key spiritual evaluation is that **believers** drink Zamzam to their fill with conviction, while **skeptics (munafiqoon)** do not, lacking the same spiritual enthusiasm.

### 6. Abraha and the Strategic Ambition in Yemen
The Prophet (saw) was born in the same year as the **Invasion of the Elephants**. The conflict began in Yemen, which had been freed from tyranny by an **Abyssinian-backed** Christian uprising. **Abraha**, a strategic general, eventually killed the devout but weak ruler Irbat and seized power. To restore Yemen's glory and **divert business and pilgrims** away from flourishing Makkah, Abraha built **Qullays**, a magnificent and glamorous church. He was so driven that he threatened to **cut off the hands** of workers who arrived at the construction site after sunrise.

### 7. The Desecration of Qullays and the Vow of Destruction
Abraha sent word to the King of Abyssinia that he would not rest until more people visited his church than the **Ka’bah**. This angered the Arabs, and a man from **Banu Kanana** secretly entered the church and **defecated on the walls** as an act of defiance. Livid at this personal insult to his legacy, Abraha swore to **destroy the Ka’bah**. He gathered **60,000 troops** and **12 elephants**—animals most Arabs had never seen—to strike fear into the hearts of the Makkans and symbolically **trample their sanctuary**.

### 8. Ethical Lessons: Respecting Sacred Spaces
Though the man from Banu Kanana believed he was showing devotion to his religion, his **despicable act of vandalism** drove Abraha to madness and led to the deaths of thousands. This event highlights a vital **Quranic principle** found in Surat Al-An’am: Muslims are forbidden from **disrespecting or cursing** the gods or symbols of others, as this triggers retaliation against Allah. While disagreement is natural, crossing the line into **vile insults** only results in greater enmity and harm to the cause of truth.
