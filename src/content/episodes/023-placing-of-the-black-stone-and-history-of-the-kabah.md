summary: "This episode details the pivotal role Muhammad (saw) played in resolving a potentially violent tribal conflict during the renovation of the Ka’bah at age 35. It explains the **structural changes** made due to financial constraints—specifically the creation of the **Hateem**—and explores the **sacred history** of the House from the time of Adam (as) to the era of the Sahaba. The narrative highlights the Prophet's **extraordinary wisdom** and the divine decree that placed him in the spotlight as **Al-Ameen** shortly before the beginning of Revelation."
highlights:
  - "The renovation saw the Ka’bah’s walls raised to 16–18 metres and the door elevated to improve security."
  - "A lack of 'pure' funds led to the Hateem area being left outside the main structure, marked only by stones."
  - "Muhammad (saw) averted a war by using his shawl to allow all tribal leaders to share the honour of moving the Black Stone."
  - "The Prophet’s reputation as Al-Ameen was so established that his entry into the Masjid brought audible relief to the quarrelling tribes."
  - "Historical principle: The Prophet chose not to reconstruct the Ka’bah to its original Ibrahimic design out of sensitivity to the new Muslims’ perceptions."
  - "Imam Malik advised against further reconstructions to prevent the Ka’bah from becoming a 'toy' for kings."
  - "Traditions like the Kiswaah and masjid expansion were established by later figures like Hajjaj ibn Yusuf and the Khulafa."

### 1. The Renovation and Structural Evolution
When Muhammad (saw) was **35 years old**, the Quraysh undertook a major renovation of the Ka’bah. Because they strictly restricted the project to using only the **purest materials and funds**, they lacked the resources to rebuild it to its original rectangular dimensions. This resulted in several key changes:
*   **The Hateem (Hijaar):** This semi-circular area was originally inside the Ka’bah, but due to lack of funds, it was left outside and marked with a low wall. Praying in the Hateem is considered as if one is **praying inside the Ka’bah**.
*   **Door Modifications:** The original structure had two doors (east and west) at ground level. The Quraysh removed the western door and **raised the eastern door** high off the ground to control access and prevent break-ins.
*   **Height:** The walls were increased from approximately 6–7 metres to **16–18 metres**.

### 2. The Dispute of the Black Stone (Al-Hajar al-Aswad)
A fierce dispute arose among the tribes over which leader would have the **honour of placing the Black Stone** back into the wall. As tensions reached a breaking point, **Abu Umayyah**, a respected elder, suggested they allow the **next person to walk through the door** (Babul Bani Shayba) to mediate or decide the matter. 

When Muhammad (saw) entered, the crowd was visibly relieved, exclaiming that **\"Al-Ameen\"** (The Trustworthy) had arrived. Muhammad (saw) devised a brilliant solution: he placed his **shawl on the ground**, set the Black Stone in the middle, and had a leader from each major tribe hold an edge. They carried it together to the wall, where Muhammad (saw) then **placed the stone into its spot with his own hands**.

### 3. Divine Decree and the Prophet’s Reputation
This incident was a **divine sign** intended to put Muhammad’s (saw) nobility and integrity on "centre stage" just a few years before his Prophethood. It established a reputation that his enemies could not later deny; they could not logically claim he was a malicious or dishonest person when they had recently trusted him with their **most sacred object**.

### 4. The Sacred History and Status of the Ka’bah
The sources cite **Surat Ali-‘Imran**, describing the Ka’bah as the **first House of worship** established for mankind. It is characterized as:
*   **Mubarraka:** Full of blessings.
*   **Guidance:** A beacon for all humanity.
*   **Sanctuary:** A place of safety and security.

The Prophet (saw) clarified to Abu Dhar that the **Masjid al-Haram** was established 40 years before **Masjid al-Aqsa**. While some narrations suggest it was established 2,000 years before the earth’s creation or by Adam (as), the majority opinion is that it holds a special distinction as the **first place of barakah** put on earth.

### 5. Historical Reconstructions and the Sunnah of Sensitivity
Following the **Conquest of Makkah**, the Prophet (saw) told Aisha (ra) that if the Quraysh were not so new to Islam, he would have **rebuilt the Ka’bah** to include the Hateem and the two original doors. Scholars derive a key principle from this: **sensitivity to a people’s culture and situation** is a Sunnah. 

Later, **Abdullah ibn Zubayr** (ra) fulfilled the Prophet's wish by rebuilding the Ka’bah in its original design. However, after his defeat, **Hajjaj ibn Yusuf** reverted it to the Qurayshi design. When a later Khalifa, **Al-Mansur**, asked **Imam Malik** if they should restore the Prophet’s desired design, the Imam forbade it, stating he did not want the Ka’bah to become a **\"toy\" for kings** to change whenever they pleased.

### 6. Traditions of Decoration and Expansion
*   **Kiswaah:** The tradition of placing the cloth covering on the Ka’bah was initiated by **Hajjaj ibn Yusuf** as a sign of respect.
*   **Expansion:** **Umar ibn al-Khattab** (ra) was the first to purchase surrounding homes to expand the Masjid al-Haram, a practice continued by **Uthman** (ra).
*   **Decoration:** The Sahaba engaged in beautifying the masjid, which confirms that **decorating a mosque is permissible** in fiqh, provided it does not replace actual dedication and worship.
