summary: "This episode discusses the pivotal transition towards the First Revelation, framing it as a turning point for a society entrenched in darkness. It explores the **divine preparation** required for such a landmark occasion, the shifting spiritual landscape regarding the jinn and soothsayers, and the Prophet's (saw) specific practice of **tahannuth (isolation)** in the Cave of Hira. The narrative emphasizes the physical and spiritual serenity found in the cave and provides a framework for modern believers to approach the Quran with similar **adab (etiquette)** and focus."
highlights:
  - "The First Revelation ended a 600-year silence of Divine communication since the time of Isa (as)."
  - "The buildup to Prophethood included historical events like the Year of the Elephant and the rediscovery of Zamzam."
  - "Shayatin reported to soothsayers that their access to heavenly information was being cut off because a Prophet was coming."
  - "Reciting the Quran serves as a direct protection against evil forces, jinn, and 'waswasa' (whisperings)."
  - "The Cave of Hira provided a private, peaceful view of the Ka’bah, allowing for deep reflection away from a corrupted society."
  - "Spiritual preparation (like wudu for prayer) is essential for connecting with the Divine."

### 1. The Context of a Darkened Society
The First Revelation was a massive turning point for the Arabs, who were viewed as "savages" by the rest of the world despite being highly enlightened in **linguistics, artistry, and intellect**. For example, even a four-year-old child could recount 20 generations of their family lineage. However, their spiritual state was in shambles. After investing ten years (ages 25–35) into his family, the Prophet’s (saw) involvement in the **reconstruction of the Ka’bah** reminded him of the dire situation of his people. He saw how **idolatry and corruption** had stripped life of meaning and direction, pushing him toward deep reflection.

### 2. The Spiritual "Warm-up" and Divine Buildup
Just as **Salah** requires preparation through wudu, clean clothes, and facing the Qiblah, the start of Divine Revelation required a significant buildup. It had been **600 years** since Allah last communicated His will to mankind through a Prophet. This preparation started long before the Prophet’s birth with events like the Year of the Elephant and the gradual **decrease of interaction** between jinn and soothsayers. 

As the time for Revelation approached, the **shayatin** were delayed in bringing news to soothsayers for months. When they finally appeared, they informed the nervous soothsayers that a Prophet was coming from the Arabs. Some jinn even traveled to Makkah to receive guidance, expressing a desire to "kiss the eyes and head of this Prophet".

### 3. The Physical and Spiritual Refuge of Hira
To clear his head, Muhammad (saw) began hiking into the mountains of **Jabal Noor**. He eventually discovered a small cave—the **Cave of Hira**—which had two openings: one for entry and a smaller one that let in a breeze. The cave was secluded, quiet, and offered a **direct view of the Ka’bah** in the distance, providing him with a sense of serenity and calm. 

Approximately **two years before the first Revelation**, the Prophet began the practice of **at-tahannuth (isolation)** during the month of Ramadan. Supported by Khadijah, who packed his supplies and understood the weight the state of society placed on him, he would stay in the cave to **deeply and quietly reflect**. This isolation was divinely inspired to **prepare his heart** for receiving the Message.

### 4. Protection through the Book of Allah
The sources highlight that a primary benefit of **dhikrullah** and reciting the Quran is protection from evil forces like jinn and *waswasa*. One former soothsayer told the Prophet that after reciting the Quran, the shayatin no longer visited him, stating that the Book was an "awesome substitute". 

While there is a reality to jinn, the sources advise a **fine balance**; believers should not attribute every clinical issue (like depression or autism) to jinn, nor should they dismiss them as mere superstition. The first line of protection is the **five daily prayers** and the recitation of **Surat al-Falaq, Surat al-Nas, Ayatul Kursi, and Surat al-Mulk**.

### 5. Lessons in Adab and Modern Application
The Prophet's time in Hira teaches that connecting with Allah requires a **process of preparation**. For 1,400 years, classical scholars have practiced specific **etiquettes (adab)** for reciting the Quran, such as making wudu, facing the Qiblah, and sitting with dignity. 

The sources recommend making an effort to engage with the Quran in a **non-electronic form**. While there is no extra virtue in paper over a phone, a printed Mus-haf prevents distractions—such as a text message asking about dinner—from interrupting the **conversation with Allah**. This focused reflection mirrors the subtle forms of divine inspiration the Prophet experienced just before the command of "Iqra" was revealed.
