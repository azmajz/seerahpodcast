### 1. Social Context: The Tradition of Wet Nurses
High-class families of the **Quraysh** in Makkah followed a tradition of sending their young children to live in the **countryside**. This was done to distance infants from the **pollution and danger** of city life, particularly during times when **diseases** led to high infant mortality. Furthermore, Makkah was a trade center where the mixing of cultures had affected the **purity of the Arabic language**. To ensure their children did not grow up speaking a corrupted version of the language, families hired women from the countryside to raise their children and teach them **pure Arabic**.

### 2. Halimah as-Sa’diya: The Choice of an Orphan
**Halimah as-Sa’diya** belonged to the tribe of **Banu Sa’ad** and was one of the poorest women who traveled to Makkah during a **severe drought** to seek a child to nurse. Because she arrived on a **weak mule** and was malnourished, she was the last woman to find a baby. Every wealthy family had already been paired with a wet nurse, leaving only the **orphan Muhammad**. Other women had rejected him because there was no father to provide a "big-time hookup" or reliable financial reward. Halimah decided to take him simply to **save face** and not return home empty-handed.

### 3. The Miracle of the Nursing and the Journey Home
The moment Halimah picked up baby Muhammad, a **miracle** occurred. Though she had been unable to produce milk for her own son for two days due to hunger, she was suddenly able to **nurse both infants to their fill**. Her husband, Al-Harith, also discovered that their old she-camel—which had been dry—now provided a **full bowl of milk**. The weak mule she rode suddenly began walking **faster than the others** on the return journey. Halimah and her husband realized that this child was the source of a **huge blessing**.

### 4. Prosperity Amidst the Banu Sa’ad Drought
When the family arrived home, their land was **barren and dry**, and their livestock was dying. However, shortly after the Prophet's arrival, their land became the **greenest in the region**. While the neighbors' animals remained weak and produced no milk, Halimah’s livestock grazed to their fill and produced an **abundance of milk**, allowing the family to start a **successful business**. The neighbors would scold their own shepherds, wondering why Al-Harith’s animals were flourishing while theirs were dying. 

### 5. Signs of Prophethood: The Cloud and the Noor
As he grew, Muhammad (saw) displayed a **magnetic 'noor' (light)** in his face and appeared **taller, stronger, and more intelligent** than average two-year-olds. He was remarkably **calm and serene**, never throwing fits. Halimah’s daughter, **Shayma**, was tasked with watching over him and witnessed a constant miracle: a **cloud always hung over him**, casting shade as he moved through the desert heat. Shayma would sit next to him just to **share the shade** provided by the cloud.

### 6. Returning to Makkah and the Extension of Care
When the Prophet reached the age of two, Halimah was required to return him to his mother, **Aminah**. Though she had formed a deep **emotional attachment** and wanted to keep the blessings he brought, she initially reunited him with his family. However, Halimah used the **outbreak of disease** in Makkah as a reason to convince Aminah that it was safer for the child to stay in the countryside. Aminah agreed, allowing Halimah to bring Muhammad (saw) back to **Banu Sa’ad** for another year and a half.
