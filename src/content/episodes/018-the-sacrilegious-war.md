summary: "This episode examines the **Harb ul-Fijar**, or the **Sacrilegious War**, a conflict that helped shape the Prophet Muhammad’s (saw) worldview during his late teens. The war was sparked by a **business dispute** between Barrad of the Quraysh and Urwaa of the Hawaazen, resulting in an **unjust murder** during the sacred month of *Dhu al-Qi’dah*. While the Quraysh fought for **nationalistic pride** and tribal honor, the young Muhammad (saw) viewed the war as **unethical and unjust**. Forced by his uncles to participate, he chose a **non-violent role** known as *atanabbul*, gathering fallen arrowheads rather than engaging in combat, demonstrating his lifelong aversion to **unnecessary bloodshed**."
highlights:
  - "The Sacrilegious War (Harb ul-Fijar) began when Muhammad (saw) was approximately 14 or 15 and lasted until he was 20."
  - "The conflict was termed 'sacrilegious' because a murder was committed unjustly during one of the four sacred months."
  - "The war was essentially a five-year standoff between Makkah (the business center) and Ta’if (the resort city), with only five actual days of battle."
  - "Muhammad (saw) avoided the rowdy social festivities and tribal badmouthing that occurred throughout the standoff."
  - "Under pressure from his uncles to defend family honor, Muhammad (saw) participated in the fiercest day of battle, Yawm Usharb."
  - "He refused to raise a sword, instead performing 'atanabbul'—gathering arrowheads for his tribe to reuse."
  - "The war ended when both sides realized the futility of the conflict and settled the matter with a treaty and blood money."

### 1. The Catalyst: A Business Dispute and Sacrilege
The word *Fijar* refers to something **inappropriate** or in violation of **ethics and religion**. The conflict began when a man named **Barrad** from the Quraysh tribe became offended after **Urwat ul-Rahal** from the Hawaazen tribe offered better deals to his business clients. After a chance meeting at a rest stop, Barrad seized an opportunity to **unjustly attack and kill** Urwaa. Because this murder took place during **Dhu al-Qi’dah**—one of the *four sacred months*—it was considered a **sacrilegious act** that violated the established religious and social codes of the Hijaaz.

### 2. The Five-Year Standoff and Tribal Honor
When news of the murder reached the **Hawaazen in Ta’if**, they marched toward Makkah demanding retribution. Rather than holding Barrad accountable or paying blood money, the **Quraysh** were driven by **nationalistic pride**, choosing to defend their honor as the *keepers of the Haram*. This led to a **five-year stalemate** similar to a 'Cold War,' as neither side wanted to see their respective cities—**Makkah (the business hub)** or **Ta’if (the vacation spot)**—destroyed. During these years, there were only **five days of actual fighting**, while the rest of the time was marked by *rowdy festivities* and tribal badmouthing, both of which the young Muhammad (saw) carefully avoided.

### 3. Atanabbul: Muhammad’s Principled Role in the Battlefield
As a young man of 14 or 15, Muhammad (saw) was **expected to take part** in warfare as a sign of manhood and tribal loyalty. His uncles pressured him to join the battle, arguing that it would be a **disgrace** if the grandson of Abdul Muttalib refused to defend the Quraysh. Muhammad (saw) pleaded with them, recognizing that the war was **unjust** because his own tribe had protected a wrongdoer. When forced onto the battlefield during **Yawm Usharb**, he refused to raise a sword. Instead, he engaged in ***atanabbul***, the task of gathering fallen **arrowheads** and stacking them for his tribe, ensuring he did not personally shed any blood.

### 4. Legacy and the Transition to Peace
The Prophet’s early experiences in the **Harb ul-Fijar** shaped his later conduct as a leader, where he consistently sought **mercy and reconciliation** over violence. Throughout his life, he welcomed opportunities for **treaties**, such as at *Hudaybiyyah*, and accepted surrenders without bloodshed, as seen during the *Opening of Makkah*. Even in the heat of battle, he would **reprimand companions** who suggested cursing the enemy, stating he was sent only as a **mercy**. The Sacrilegious War eventually ended when the tribes grew tired of the conflict, settling through a **treaty** where the Quraysh provided **blood money** for the initial murder, leading to the formation of the **Hilf ul-Fudl**.
