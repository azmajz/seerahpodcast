### 1. The Islamic Philosophy of Balanced Living
The sources state that the Prophet was never inclined toward **materialism or wealth**, yet he did not advocate for the extreme of total withdrawal from the world. He taught that sitting around and expecting Allah to provide without effort is not *tawakkul* (trust), but **laziness**, which he condemned as a disease of the heart. Instead, he championed a **middle path**: utilizing the means available to be a responsible human being while leaving the outcome to Allah—a concept encapsulated in his saying, **\"Trust Allah, but tie your camel\"**.

### 2. Early Career and Local Brokering
In his early 20s, Muhammad (saw) focused on establishing himself financially as a prerequisite for marriage. Because he was an orphan with **no inheritance** and his uncle Abu Talib was not wealthy, he could not afford his own merchandise. Consequently, he entered the business of **brokering deals on commission**, acting as a middleman between wholesalers and retailers. During this time, he partnered with **As-Saib bin Abi Saib**, an honest man whom the Prophet remembered and complimented for his integrity decades later during the *Opening of Makkah*.

### 3. Business Partnership with Khadijah
**Khadijah bint Khuwaylid**, a wealthy and successful businesswoman, frequently hired men to lead trade caravans to **Syria (Bilad al-Shaam)**. Having heard of Muhammad’s reputation as **Sadiq al-Amin** (the Truthful, the Trustworthy), she offered him **twice the standard commission** to manage her business. Although Abu Talib was initially hesitant due to past warnings about his nephew's safety, he eventually agreed to the trip. Khadijah sent her skilled slave and bodyguard, **Maysara**, to accompany Muhammad (saw) and look after her interests.

### 4. Miraculous Signs in Syria
During the journey, a monk residing near the monastery where the Prophet had previously met *Bahira* observed Muhammad (saw) resting under a tree. The monk informed Maysara that **\"no man will sit underneath that tree... except for a Prophet\"**. Throughout the return trip, Maysara witnessed further extraordinary events, such as the Prophet appearing perfectly calm in the extreme heat because **angels were providing shade** for him. Upon their return, Muhammad (saw) provided Khadijah with a **precise and honest breakdown** of all dealings, which impressed her even more than the significant profits he generated.

### 5. A Marriage Proposal Founded on Character
Khadijah, who often received proposals from men she feared were only interested in her wealth, found herself increasingly impressed by Muhammad’s **intelligence and integrity**. After consulting her cousin **Waraqah bin Nawfal**, who spoke highly of Muhammad (saw), she decided to pursue a marriage. She sent her friend **Nafisa** to sound out the Prophet, who expressed his own high regard for Khadijah, calling her an **exemplary, honest, and trustworthy woman**. Once mutual interest was confirmed, the proposal was brought to his uncle **Abu Talib** to finalize the arrangement.

### 6. Lessons on Marriage and Sincerity
The sources emphasize that both Muhammad (saw) and Khadijah prioritized **character and internal virtue** over material or superficial qualifiers. In modern times, the sources suggest that people often fall into the trap of choosing partners based on **social status, wealth, or superficial religious markers** like clothing. The Seerah teaches that **character is a manifestation of true deen**, as it demonstrates the sincerity of one's faith beyond outward appearances. The Prophet’s life remains a model of how to establish relationships based on **remembering the good in others** and valuing integrity above all else.
