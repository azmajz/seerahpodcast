### 1. Business Ethics: Mudaraba and Practical Guidance
Before his Prophethood, Muhammad (saw) was a successful businessman who established his credibility through **honesty and fairness**,. Lacking capital of his own as an orphan, he engaged in ***mudaraba***, a practice where one partner invests money and the other provides the labor to sell merchandise,. The sources explain that the Prophet later encouraged this system because it ensures **shared risk and profit**, unlike moneylending where the lender always wins while the borrower bears all the risk,. This practical experience allowed him to later provide **Uswatul Hasana** (the best example) for merging spiritual, family, and business lives,.

### 2. A Marriage Founded on Character
The union between Muhammad (saw) and Khadijah was built on **mutual respect for character** rather than material gain,. Khadijah proposed because of the Prophet's **honesty, excellent character, and the way he maintained relationships**, while he praised her as the **most honorable and dignified woman** of the Quraysh,. Although common for elite families to have multiple wives, the Prophet remained in a **monogamous marriage** with Khadijah for 25 years due to his deep love for her. The sources emphasize that **akhlaq** (conduct) is the heaviest thing on the scales on the Day of Judgment and should be the **crux of choosing a spouse**.

### 3. The Nikkah Ceremony and Family Dynamics
The marriage ceremony involved a meeting of the families where **Abu Talib** spoke on his nephew's behalf, describing him as a **treasure** despite his lack of wealth,. While the majority of the sources state Khadijah's brother or uncle oversaw the nikkah, a minority account mentions her father, **Khuwaylid**, who was reportedly so intoxicated he caused a commotion before eventually giving his blessing,,,. The **mahr** was a modest 20 goats or camels, which was respectable for elite families but avoided **tabdeer** (wasteful spending),.

### 4. The Prophet as a Father: Grief and Patience
Muhammad (saw) and Khadijah had **two sons** (Qasem and Abdullah) and **four daughters** (Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Ummu Khulthum, and Fatimah),,. Tragically, both sons died in early childhood, and three of his daughters passed away during his lifetime due to injury or illness,,. Out of his **seven total children**, only Fatimah outlived him, though she passed away six months after his death,. These personal tragedies made the Prophet a **pillar of patience**, ensuring he understood the **pain and suffering** of his Ummah from a place of deep personal experience.

### 5. Practical Lessons for Modern Relationships
The sources warn against two extremes in modern marriage: choosing partners solely for **wealth and status**, or relying on **superficial religious qualifiers** like a beard or hijab without assessing true character,. The Prophet's life teaches the importance of **financial responsibility** before marriage, as he refused to marry until he had a source of income to support a family,. Ultimately, the marriage of Muhammad (saw) and Khadijah serves as a **role model** for building relationships on **sincerity, dignity, and virtue**.
