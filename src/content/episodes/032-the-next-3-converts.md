summary: "This episode focuses on the first converts outside of Khadijah (ra), detailing the acceptance of Islam by the young **Ali bin Abi Talib**, the devoted **Zayd bin Harithah**, and the Prophet’s closest friend, **Abu Bakr al-Siddiq**. It explores the early practice of secret family prayer, the emotional story of Zayd's choice to stay with the Prophet over his biological family, and the legal distinction between **adoption** and *at-tabanni* in Islamic law. The narrative concludes with the unwavering conviction of Abu Bakr, the first man to take the message into the public sphere."
highlights:
  - "Ali bin Abi Talib accepted Islam at age 10, reportedly the very next day after the first revelation."
  - "The Prophet, Khadijah, and Ali were observed praying at the Ka’bah by a merchant named Ufaif, who later regretted not joining them then."
  - "Zayd bin Harithah chose to remain with the Prophet rather than return home with his biological father, Harithah."
  - "Islamic law permits adoption (caring for orphans) but forbids *at-tabanni* (claiming an adopted child as a biological son)."
  - "Abu Bakr was the first free man outside the Prophet's household to believe, accepting the message without a moment of hesitation."
  - "The Prophet’s 40-year reputation for truthfulness was the primary reason his childhood friend, Abu Bakr, believed him instantly."

### 1. Ali bin Abi Talib: The First Child to Believe
Ali was only **10 years old** when he accepted Islam, likely on the Tuesday following the first Monday of revelation. Because Islam was new and the Prophet was commanded to keep it within the home, Ali was initially nervous about how his father, **Abu Talib**, would react. Consequently, Ali stayed at the Prophet's house for three weeks without visiting his parents to avoid difficult questions. While some narrations suggest he waited a year to convert, scholars reconcile this by noting that Ali simply kept his faith **very quiet** for that first year.

### 2. Ufaif and the Witness of the Three Believers
A powerful merchant named **Ufaif** once visited Makkah to trade with the Prophet’s uncle, **Abbas**. While sitting near the Ka’bah, he witnessed a man (the Prophet) approach the House to pray, followed by a woman (Khadijah) and a young boy (Ali). Abbas explained to the bewildered Ufaif that Muhammad claimed to be a Messenger and that his wife and cousin were his only followers. This account confirms that **salah was part of Islam from the very beginning**, practiced as a family activity even before the five daily prayers were formally established.

### 3. Zayd bin Harithah: Devotion Over Lineage
Zayd was a young boy snatched by a caravan and sold as a slave in Makkah, eventually becoming a gift for Khadijah, who then gave him to the Prophet. Muhammad (saw) treated Zayd with such love that when Zayd's biological father, **Harithah**, eventually found him and offered a ransom, Zayd famously chose to **stay with Muhammad** over his own family. Moved by this devotion, the Prophet took Zayd to the Ka’bah and publicly **adopted him**, after which he was known as *Zayd bin Muhammad* until later Quranic revelation restored his biological name.

### 4. Clarification on Adoption and 'At-tabanni'
The sources clarify a common "gross mistranslation" found in some early English texts suggesting that adoption is *haraam* (forbidden). In reality, Islam highly recommends caring for orphans, but it forbids ***at-tabanni***—the act of claiming an adopted child is one's **biological offspring** and erasing their true lineage. When you refer to someone as an "adopted son," you are correctly acknowledging they are not biological, which is permissible. Following the revelation of *Surat Al-Ahzab*, Zayd was called **Zayd bin Harithah** or *Zayd maula Muhammad* (a term for a close, family-like associate).

### 5. Abu Bakr: The First Public Believer
Abu Bakr was the first free man and public figure outside the Prophet’s home to accept Islam. A respected and wealthy leader of the Quraysh, he was the Prophet's **childhood best friend** from the age of 10. When Muhammad (saw) informed him of his Prophethood, Abu Bakr **did not hesitate or doubt** for a single second. The Prophet later remarked that while everyone else "slept on it" or hesitated, Abu Bakr attested to the truth immediately.

### 6. The Testimony of Character
Abu Bakr’s instant belief was rooted in his 30-year friendship with the Prophet; he knew that Muhammad had **never lied** and always possessed impeccable character. The Prophet deeply valued this loyalty, later rebuking others during disputes by reminding them that when the world called him a liar, **Abu Bakr said he spoke the truth** and aided him with his life and money. The Sahabi poet **Hasan bin Thabit** later immortalised Abu Bakr as the "second of the two in the cave" and the most trustworthy of people after the Prophet.
