### 1. The Oppression of Abu Jahl and the Iraashi Man
By the 3rd or 4th year of Prophethood, the message of Islam was public, and **Abu Jahl** had established himself as a primary culprit of aggression against believers. He displayed his lack of integrity by scamming a humble villager from the tribe of **Iraash**. After taking the man's merchandise, Abu Jahl refused to pay, knowing the man had no local tribe to defend him. When the man called for justice at the Haram, the Quraysh leaders mocked him.

### 2. The Prophet’s (saw) Courageous Intervention
Seeking to mock the Prophet further, the Quraysh suggested he help the Iraashi man, knowing the two men did not get along. The Prophet, refusing to be a "doormat," took the man to Abu Jahl’s door and curtly commanded him to come outside. Upon seeing the Prophet, Abu Jahl turned **extremely pale** and looked terrified; he immediately ran inside, grabbed the money, and settled the debt.

### 3. The Miraculous Vision of the Camel
When the confused Makkans questioned Abu Jahl on why he had been so submissive, he revealed a supernatural encounter. He claimed that when he opened the door, he saw the **largest wild desert camel** he had ever seen towering over Muhammad (saw). He believed that if he had refused the Prophet, the camel—described as a mentally unstable *fahal*—would have **broken his neck**.

### 4. Abu Bakr’s (ra) Physical Defense
In a separate incident at the Haram, Abu Jahl attempted to **strangle the Prophet** with a scarf while he was praying. **Abu Bakr (ra)** immediately ran to the Prophet’s aid, body-checking Abu Jahl and pushing him aside. He invoked the same logic used by a secret believer in the court of **Pharaoh**, asking the Quraysh if they truly intended to kill a man simply for his belief in one Lord.

### 5. The Prophet (saw) Stands His Ground
The sources note that while the Prophet always maintained superb character, he was also capable of being firm. During one tawaaf around the Ka’bah, Abu Jahl and his crew repeatedly shouted **crude and foul things**. The Prophet eventually walked over to them and stated, **"Wallahi, Allah has sent me to you with sacrifice"**—implying the cutting of a throat. This sudden, stern declaration from a man known for never losing his cool left the leaders of the Quraysh visibly stunned and silent.
