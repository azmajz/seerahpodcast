### 1. The Guardianship and Affection of Abdul Muttalib
At age six, after the passing of **Aminah**, the young Muhammad (saw) was brought back to Makkah by **Ummu Ayman** to live with his grandfather. **Abdul Muttalib** was a remarkable leader—devout, moral, and regarded as the **most powerful man in Arabia**. Despite his immense responsibilities, he made Muhammad the **most important aspect of his life**, personally checking on him every night before sleep and refusing to eat until he was certain Muhammad had eaten first. He showed more kindness to his grandson than to his own children; while no one dared sit on his **reserved cushion** at the Ka’bah, he would allow the young boy to sit there, telling his uncles to leave him alone because **\"he looks like a king\"** and was meant for something special.

### 2. Transition of Care to Abu Talib
When Muhammad was eight, his grandfather passed away, though some historical accounts suggest Abdul Muttalib lived to be **153 years old**. Before his death, he gathered his children to distribute responsibilities, singling out **Abu Talib** to take over Muhammad's guardianship. Abu Talib was the **full brother of Abdullah**, the Prophet’s father, sharing the same mother, Fatimah. While Abu Talib took on the care of his nephew, the responsibility for the **Well of Zamzam** and the **custodianship of the Haram** was passed to another son, **al-Abbas**. Abu Talib was highly overprotective, having been warned by his father and having observed **Jewish and Christian scholars** watching the boy closely, suspecting him to be the **Prophet of this Ummah**.

### 3. Life and Miracles in the Household of Abu Talib
**Abu Talib** was a *zahid*—a man of simple means with no desire for material wealth. Although his household often had **very little food**, a recurring miracle occurred: whenever Muhammad sat to eat with the family, the same small portion of food would **miraculously suffice for everyone**, often leaving leftovers. Abu Talib loved him immensely, ensuring he had the **best cuts of meat** and never going out or to sleep without him. Unlike other children, Muhammad never woke up with messy hair or gunk in his eyes; he always appeared **bright, clean, and clear**, with eyes that looked as if they naturally had *kohl* on them.

### 4. Extraordinary Character and Dignified Conduct
From a young age, Muhammad (saw) exhibited a **dignified manner of behaving** that stood in stark contrast to other children. At mealtimes, while other children might behave like animals and fight over food, Muhammad would **stand aside quietly**, waiting for his turn. Noticing this, Abu Talib would set aside a portion of food early to ensure his nephew could eat with **adaab (manners)** once the other children had finished. This inherent nobility was a constant source of wonder for Abu Talib, who would often look at him and remark, **\"My son, there is something special about you\"**.

### 5. Recognition by the Bedouin Soothsayer
A famous Bedouin **soothsayer** once visited Makkah, and Abu Talib took his children to see him as was the local tradition. After staring at Muhammad for a long time, the fortune teller **panicked** when Abu Talib tried to leave, shouting for the boy to be brought back because he was **not an ordinary child** and was destined for greatness. Sensing a **creepy and intense interest**, an overprotective Abu Talib quickly fled with the children. It is noted that such soothsayers were often influenced by *shayatin* who sought information from the angels; the *shayatin* may have been trying to **identify and target** the special child.
