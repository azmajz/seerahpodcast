summary: "This episode covers the **resumption of Revelation** following a brief pause due to the Prophet's (saw) physical illness, a period of recuperation described metaphorically in **Surat Ad-Duha**. It details the first four key revelations—**Al-Alaq, Al-Qalam, Al-Muzzammil, and Al-Muddaththir**—which established the spiritual and ethical foundations of Islam. The narrative also highlights the **first converts**, led by **Khadijah (ra)**, and the initiation of **ritual purification (wudu)** and prayer within the privacy of the Prophet’s household."
highlights:
  - "Allah paused Revelation briefly to allow the Prophet (saw) to physically recover from the heavy toll of the divine encounter."
  - "Surat Al-Qalam emphasised that the Prophet’s great moral character (akhlaq) would be instrumental to his mission."
  - "Surat Al-Muzzammil established night prayer as a spiritual foundation before any social or public action."
  - "Surat Al-Muddaththir provided the first call to action: to 'arise and warn' humanity out of love and concern."
  - "Khadijah (ra) was the first to believe, serving as the Prophet’s 'aid and minister' who lightened the burden of his distress."
  - "Ali (ra) was the first child to convert, joining the Prophet and Khadijah in prayer after a night of reflection."
  - "Jibril (as) miraculously provided Zamzam water behind Mount Safaa to teach the Prophet the method of ritual purification."

### 1. The Pause and Resumption of Revelation
After the initial encounter in the cave, the Prophet (saw) became **physically ill** for a few days due to the immense weight of bearing the Message. The sources explain that Allah, in His mercy, paused the Revelation to allow him to **physically recuperate**. This pause is described in **Surat Ad-Duha**, which uses the brilliance of the sun to represent receiving Revelation and the quiet of the night to represent the necessary pause. Allah reassured him: **\"Your Lord has not abandoned you nor is He upset with you\"**.

### 2. The First Four Foundations
The first four revelations provided a roadmap for the Prophet’s personal and public life:
*   **Surat Al-Alaq (The 1st):** The command to recite and acknowledge Allah as the Creator and Teacher.
*   **Surat Al-Qalam (The 2nd):** A consolation that the Prophet was not a madman and a reminder that his **great moral character** would ensure he never lost himself during the trials to come.
*   **Surat Al-Muzzammil (The 3rd):** The instruction to build a **solid spiritual foundation** through night prayer before engaging with people.
*   **Surat Al-Muddaththir (The 4th):** The transition to public duty, commanding him to **\"arise and warn\"**. In this context, to "warn" means to caution others out of **love and concern** for their well-being.

### 3. The Ethical Requirements of Dawah
The sources note that the command to **\"purify your clothes\"** in Surat Al-Muddaththir has multiple layers. It refers to being physically presentable as a representative of the *deen*, but more importantly, it signifies the **purification of character and akhlaq**. The command to **\"avoid filth\"** (*rujz*) encompasses shirk, obscene speech, and bad behaviour. The Prophet was told that even though he was already *Sadiq al-Ameen*, he must completely give up any wayward actions as he would be pushed to his limits during his mission.

### 4. Khadijah (ra): The First Believer and Aid
**Khadijah (ra)** was the first person to accept Islam. She acted as the Prophet’s **aid and minister**, and Allah used her to **lighten the load** of Prophethood. Every time the Prophet faced rejection or was called a liar, Khadijah would strengthen him and remove his distress. As a reward for her support, Allah commanded the Prophet to congratulate her with a **palace in Paradise carved from a single pearl**, where there would be no noise or hardship.

### 5. Ali (ra) and the First Household of Prayer
The first child to convert was the Prophet’s young cousin, **Ali (ra)**. Because of economic hardship in Makkah, the Prophet had taken Ali into his own care to assist his uncle, Abu Talib. After seeing the Prophet and Khadijah praying, Ali inquired about their actions. Though he initially wanted to consult his father, Ali **slept on it** and accepted Islam the following morning, testifying that there is no god but Allah.

### 6. The Initiation of Ritual Purification and Salah
While the five daily prayers were established much later, **salah existed from the very beginning** of Prophethood, performed twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening. **Jibril (as)** took the Prophet to a private spot behind Mount Safaa and miraculously caused a **spring of Zamzam** to emerge. He then taught the Prophet **ritual purification (wudu)** and the movements of prayer. The Prophet immediately returned home and taught Khadijah, and from that day on, the couple **prayed together in the privacy of their home**.

### 7. The Phases of Dawah
According to Ibn Qayyim, the mission of dawah progressed through five phases:
1.  **Prophethood (An-Nabua):** Internalising the message and sharing it with those closest to him (lasted 3 years in Makkah).
2.  **Warning Close Tribes:** Preaching to Banu Hashim and Quraysh without retaliation (lasted 10 years).
3.  **Preaching to Makkah:** Permitted to respond to aggression; lasted until the Treaty of Hudaybiya.
4.  **Preaching to the Arab Region:** Lasted until the end of the Prophet's life.
5.  **The Ummah’s Mission:** Carried out by the Sahaba to the four corners of the world.
