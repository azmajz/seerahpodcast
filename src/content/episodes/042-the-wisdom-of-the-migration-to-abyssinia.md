summary: "This episode explores the Prophet’s (saw) strategic decision to 'export' 90% of the Muslim community to Abyssinia to preserve their safety and allow their **imaan to nurture** away from the hostility of Makkah. It details the Quraysh's retaliatory mission led by **Amr ibn al-’As** and **Umara ibn Walid**, who attempted to bribe the Abyssinian court with rare gifts. The narrative also highlights the stark contrast between the **steadfastness of the early Sahaba** and the subsequent trials of those who opposed the message."
highlights:
  - "The Prophet sent the vast majority of Muslims away so they could grow strong enough to eventually aid him when needed."
  - "By removing the Muslims, the 'agitation' and tension in Makkah significantly decreased."
  - "The Quraysh feared the migrants would build a foreign army and return to attack Makkah."
  - "Amr ibn al-’As was selected for his political savvy and international travel experience, while Umara was chosen for his high-profile family status."
  - "The Quraysh specifically prepared tanned Arabian camel hides as gifts, as they were rare and highly valued in Abyssinia."
  - "Umara ibn Walid, an arrogant man who once mocked the Prophet, eventually lost his mind and died in exile."

### 1. The Strategy of Preservation
The Prophet (saw) acted with deep concern for the **spiritual development and preservation** of the Muslims. He implemented a strategy to move 90% of the community to Abyssinia, leaving only about a dozen high-profile individuals—such as himself and Abu Bakr—who could not be easily touched due to their tribal status. This move was intended to let the believers **nurture their faith** in a safe environment until they were strong enough to return and support the mission. Additionally, this mass departure reduced the "agitation" in Makkah, as the Quraysh no longer felt as though their society was being constantly "poked".

### 2. The Philosophy of Avoiding Fitna
The Prophet’s (saw) actions were rooted in a philosophy of **protecting the community from the evil of people**. The sources describe an instance where the Prophet was courteous to a known troublemaker specifically to **prevent his wrath** and protect the people from harm. Similarly, the migration was a way to de-escalate the conflict in Makkah while ensuring the message could survive elsewhere.

### 3. The Quraysh Counter-Mission
The Quraysh leaders were alarmed by the migration, fearing that the Muslims would **settle, build an army, and return** to conquer Makkah. To prevent this, they recruited a delegation to bring them back:
*   **Amr ibn al-’As:** A highly intelligent, cultured, and **politically savvy** man who had travelled extensively to Rome, Persia, and Egypt.
*   **Umara ibn Walid:** The "pretty face" of the Quraysh, who was arrogant and came from an **extremely powerful family**.
The group collected funds and prepared **expensive gifts** for the King of Abyssinia (As-hama or an-Najashi), including highly sought-after **red Arabian camel skins** used for blankets.

### 4. The Journey and Internal Conflict
The journey to Abyssinia was marked by the **wretched behaviour of Umara ibn Walid**. Umara made highly disrespectful advances toward Amr’s wife and later **threw Amr overboard** into the sea while he was off-guard. Fortunately, Amr was a capable swimmer—a rarity for Makkans—and climbed back onto the boat, asserting his intellectual superiority over the "idiot" Umara. Upon arrival, they began **bribing key ministers** in the King's court to secure an audience and frame the Muslims as runaway "slaves" who would eventually cause trouble for the Abyssinians.

### 5. The Tragic Fate of Umara ibn Walid
Umara had a history of malice, having once participated in **dumping heavy camel guts** on the Prophet’s back while he was in prostration. In Abyssinia, his arrogance continued as he attempted to conspire with rebels against King an-Najashi. Consequently, he **lost his mind** and fled into the wilderness. Years later, during the khilafa of Umar ibn al-Khattab, Muslims found him in the wild suffering from a **severe social phobia and paranoia**. When they tried to restrain him to nurse him back to health, he died that same evening.

### 6. Legacy of the Early Sahaba
The sources contrast the experience of the early Sahaba with later generations (the *tabiyoon*). While later soldiers might be impressed by "armies of steel," the veterans of the early era remained grounded in the **hardships they endured**—from the hunger of the Trenches to the trials of Badr and Uhud. Their tenacity was forged in the very struggles the Prophet (saw) sought to manage through the migration to Abyssinia.
