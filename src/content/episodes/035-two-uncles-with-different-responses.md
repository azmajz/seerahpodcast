### 1. The Public Preaching and Social Response
As the Prophet (saw) began preaching publicly in town squares and marketplaces, the general population of Makkah found it difficult to speak against him because he was widely known as a man of the **highest calibre, honesty, and trustworthiness**. His message called for a total shift in **theology, lifestyle, and ethics**. He addressed everyone—rich and poor, weak and powerful—without priority. However, the leaders of the Quraysh, who were insistent upon their **idol-worship (shirk)**, began to oppose him, led most severely by his uncle **Abu Lahab**.

### 2. The Hostility of Abu Lahab and Arwa
Abu Lahab (born Abdul Uzza) was a **wealthy business leader** who used his economic power to oppose Islam. He was nicknamed "Abu Lahab" because his fair complexion would turn a **flaming red** when he spoke intensely. He and his wife, **Arwa (Ummu Jamil)**, made it their mission to harass the Prophet (saw):
*   **Physical Harassment:** Abu Lahab would follow the Prophet in marketplaces, screaming that he was a **liar and a lunatic** to distract potential listeners. He even carried a sack of stones to throw at the **back of the Prophet's head** during dawah.
*   **Domestic Malice:** Being a neighbour, Arwa would frequently **throw trash and dirt** on the Prophet’s doorstep and at him personally in public.
*   **Family Betrayal:** To further humiliate the Prophet (saw), Abu Lahab forced his two sons to **divorce or break betrothals** with the Prophet’s daughters, Ummu Khultum and Ruqqaiyah. One son went as far as ripping the Prophet’s shirt and spitting on him.

### 3. The Revelation of Surah Lahab
In response to this persistent harassment, Allah revealed **Surah Lahab**, which prophesied the ruin of Abu Lahab and his wife. It declared that his wealth would not benefit him and that he and his wife—described as the **"carrier of firewood"**—would burn in a blazing fire.

### 4. The Protective Loyalty of Abu Talib
In stark contrast to Abu Lahab, **Abu Talib** provided a shield of protection for his nephew. While Abu Lahab was economically influential, Abu Talib was the **civic and social leader** of Banu Hashim and the custodian of the Haram. His support was deeply personal, as he had raised Muhammad (saw) since the age of eight. 
*   **Support for Ali:** When Abu Talib saw his son **Ali (ra)** praying with the Prophet, he did not get angry. Instead, he told Ali to follow Muhammad because he was a **man of great integrity**.
*   **Defiance of Quraysh:** When the Quraysh complained about the "nuisance" of the preaching, the Prophet (saw) informed his uncle that he was as incapable of stopping his mission as he was of **bringing a flame back from the sun**.

### 5. The "Sun and Moon" Declaration
During another confrontation where the Quraysh pressured Abu Talib to stop his nephew, the Prophet (saw) delivered a famous ultimatum: **"If the sun was put in my right hand, and the moon was put in my left hand, I would not stop preaching... until Allah has made His message apparent... or until I die trying"**. The Prophet (saw) was moved to tears by the thought that he might be a **burden** to his aging uncle or that Abu Talib might turn his back on him. 

### 6. Abu Talib’s Final Vow
Seeing the Prophet's sadness, Abu Talib reaffirmed his loyalty with **powerful poetry**, vowing that the Quraysh would never harm him as long as he was alive. He acknowledged that the Prophet had **spoken the truth** and presented the best way of life on Earth. However, Abu Talib confessed that his own **weakness**—specifically the fear of people's insults—prevented him from formally accepting the message, though he remained committed to defending the Prophet to his grave.
