### 1. The Miraculous Event in the Boondocks
During the first three to five years of his life, the young Muhammad (saw) lived with **Halimah and her family** in a remote rural area. The splitting of his chest is estimated to have happened when he was between **two and four years old**, though his clear memory of the event suggests he was likely closer to **four or four and a half**. The incident was first witnessed by Halimah’s biological son, **Abdullah**, who ran back to his parents terrified and panting, shouting about his **'Qurayshi brother'**. Abdullah described seeing **two men in white clothes** who descended from the sky as if flying, laid Muhammad down, and began **cutting him open**.

### 2. The Spiritual Cleansing and the Golden Dish
When Halimah and her husband Al-Harith reached Muhammad, they found him standing **pale and frightened**. The Prophet later provided a detailed account to his Sahaba, even pulling off his shirt to show the **scar running from the hollow of his neck to his navel**. He explained that the angels took out his heart and removed a **black blood clot**—a physical representation of *evil or sin*—and threw it away. They then placed his heart in a **dish made of gold** and washed both his heart and his internal organs with **Zamzam water and ice** before putting everything back. This physical procedure served as a **public sign** to the child and his guardians that he was destined for greatness.

### 3. Outweighing the Ummah: A Test of Fortitude
Following the cleansing, the angels performed a symbolic weighing to measure the Prophet's **imaan, endurance, and emotional fortitude**. They weighed him against ten people of his Ummah, then a hundred, and finally **a thousand**; in every instance, Muhammad (saw) **outweighed them all**. The angels concluded that if he were weighed against his **entire Ummah**, he would still outweigh them. This immense strength was later seen on his deathbed when he asked to take the **pains and suffering** of the entire Ummah upon himself. He proved capable of putting up with more **hurt and threat** than any average human.

### 4. Returning to Aminah and the Birth Miracles
Drained of colour and in shock, Muhammad was carried home by his nursing parents. Fearing a **supernatural force** was after him, Al-Harith insisted on returning the child to **Aminah** in Makkah immediately, though they initially tried to hide the reason to avoid worrying her. However, Aminah sensed their fear and insisted on the truth. Upon hearing the story, she remained **unfazed**, explaining that **Shaytan** could have no power over him. She recounted miracles from his birth: a pregnancy with **no burden**, a light that illuminated the **palaces of Syria**, and the fact that he was born **leaning on his hands** and staring at the sky rather than crying.

### 5. Theological Significance and the Heaviness of Revelation
While some dismiss this event as "imagination," it remains an **authentic test of imaan** that extends beyond modern rationality. This heart-cleansing occurred at least **twice**—once in childhood and again during the **Night Journey (Al-Isra Wal-Mi’raj)**—with some weaker narrations suggesting a third time around age ten or twelve. This procedure was specific to the Prophet (**ikhtisas**) and was not a literal medical blueprint for others. It served to **strengthen his heart** to bear the "heavy word" of the Quran. The physical weight of revelation was so intense that it once nearly **crushed Aisha’s leg** and caused animals he was riding to **moan and sit down**.

### 6. Divine Decree: Lessons on Orphanhood and Diversity
The Prophet’s life experiences were fixed by **Divine Plan** to serve as a lesson for future generations. Losing both parents by age six was no coincidence; it established him as the **first orphan of the Ummah**, showing there is **no indignity or negative association** attached to being an orphan. Furthermore, the fact that two of his milk-mothers were **African** and one of his paternal aunts was **albino** served as a model against the **ethnic pride** of Arab society. These details provide **emotional consolation** to those in similar situations, teaching that everyone should be showered with the same **care and love** one would show the Messenger of Allah.

### 7. The Prophet and his Shaytan
The cleansing of the Prophet's heart freed him from the influences of the **nafs and carnal desires**. He later explained to Aisha (ra) that while every human has a **Shaytan** attached to them to lead them astray, his own Shaytan had **become a Muslim**. Because of this, his Shaytan had **no control over him**; rather, the Prophet controlled him. This was part of the divine protection that allowed the Prophet to remain perfectly guided throughout his mission.
