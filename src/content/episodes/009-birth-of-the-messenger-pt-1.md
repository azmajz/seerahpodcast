### 1. The Significance of Monday and the Birth Date
The Prophet was born on a **Monday** in the month of **Rabi' al-Awwal** during the **Year of the Elephant**. Monday holds immense spiritual weight, as it was also the day he received **revelation**, left Makkah for **Hijrah**, arrived in Madinah, and ultimately **passed away**. While various dates are cited—such as the 2nd, 8th, or 10th—the most popular narration states he was born on the **12th of Rabi' al-Awwal**, which corresponds to **April 25, 571 CE**. This occurred roughly **50–55 days** after the failed invasion of the elephants.

### 2. Miracles During Pregnancy and Childbirth
Throughout her pregnancy, Aminah reportedly felt **no pain or discomfort**. She experienced powerful dreams in which a **Noor (light)** emanated from her, illuminating the *palaces of Syria*. Angels informed her that she was carrying the **leader of this Ummah** and instructed her to seek Allah’s protection for him. At the moment of birth, witnessed by women such as **As-Shifa** and the mother of **Uthman ibn Abi al-Aas**, a brilliant light filled the house. The stars reportedly appeared so close to the earth that they seemed as if they might **fall**. Upon arrival, the newborn sat upon his **knees** with his eyes staring toward the **sky**.

### 3. Naming the Messenger: Muhammad and Ahmad
Abdul Muttalib, the child's guardian, was informed of the miraculous light and took his grandson to the **Ka’bah** to make *dua*. He recited couplets praising Allah for this **blessed and noble child** and placed him under divine protection from hatred and jealousy. Although the name **Muhammad** (the repeatedly praised) was rare in *al-Hijaz*, it was chosen alongside **Ahmad** (the abundantly praised). The Prophet later noted that his name was **Ahmad** in the Tawrut and Injeel, and **Muhammad** in the Quran. These names stem from the root *hamd*, signifying one who is **constantly worthy of praise**.

### 4. Lineage, Orphanhood, and Divine Protection
The Prophet was born into a **blessed lineage**, stating himself that he was born through **nikkah (marriage)** and not through sin; scholars note that no one in his entire ancestry was born out of wedlock. He was born a **yatim (orphan)**, as his father Abdullah passed away in **Yathrib** before the birth. This status is confirmed in **Surat Ad-Duha**, which asks, *“Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge?”*. This orphanhood was part of a divine arrangement to ensure his **mentorship and confidence** remained solely with Allah.

### 5. Circumcision and the Aqiqah Feast
On the **7th day** after the birth, Abdul Muttalib performed a **huge feast**, known as an *aqiqah*, which was a tradition inherited from **Ibrahim (as)**. There is a scholarly discussion regarding the Prophet’s **circumcision**. Some narrations suggest Abdul Muttalib performed it at the Ka'bah, while others propose he was **born circumcised** with the umbilical cord already cut, as an *honour and miracle* from Allah. Regardless of how it transpired, scholars agree he was circumcised in accordance with the **Sunnah of all Prophets**.

### 6. Perspectives on Marking the Day of Birth
The significance of marking the Prophet's birthday is a subject of **varied scholarly opinion**. Some classical and modern scholars, such as **Shaykh Abdullah ibn Bayyah**, find no harm in acknowledging the day for **educational purposes** and historical reflection, provided no *specific unrooted virtues* are attached to it. Other scholars advise caution to avoid **extremes**, either in inappropriate celebrations or in outright condemnation of those who simply wish to **teach the Seerah**. Ultimately, this is viewed as a **non-fundamental issue** that should not divide the Ummah.
