### 1. The Core Community and Initial Persecution
The early Muslim community was a diverse mix of individuals from various social standings. While **Abu Talib** protected the Prophet (saw) and **Banu Taym** protected Abu Bakr, other believers were at the mercy of the Quraysh. Vulnerable Muslims were often dressed in **iron armour** and left to roast in the 140-degree desert sun. **Bilal (ra)**, as a slave, faced the harshest treatment; he was tied up and dragged through the streets by the children of Makkah, yet he continued to proclaim **"Ahad, al-Ahad"** (One, the Unique).

### 2. Abu Bakr (ra): The Master of Dawah
Abu Bakr was a prestigious businessman known for abstaining from social evils like intoxication. Within the first two days of his conversion, he brought several major figures to the Prophet (saw), including **Uthman ibn Affan, Zubayr, Talhah, Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas, and Abdul Rahman bin Awf**. As an expert **genealogist**, he used his knowledge of family lineages to effectively open conversations and guide others toward the faith. Because he guided these individuals, he receives a **duplicate reward** for all their subsequent service to Islam, meaning his "Book of Deeds" is still recording rewards today.

### 3. The Story of Talhah ibn Ubaydullah
While in a market in Busra, **Talhah** met a worshipper who asked if "Ahmad," the final Prophet, had appeared in Makkah yet. Upon returning to Makkah, Talhah learned that Muhammad (saw) had proclaimed prophethood and Abu Bakr had followed him. After Abu Bakr confirmed this, Talhah accepted Islam. This led to them being kidnapped and tied together with one rope by **Nawfal bin Khuwailid** (the "Lion of Quraysh"). This shared trial earned them the lifelong nickname **Al-Karenayn** (The Best Buddies).

### 4. The First Public Call and Sacrifice
Against the Prophet’s (saw) initial warnings that they were too few, Abu Bakr insisted the Muslims **go public**. At the Haram, Abu Bakr stood as the **first speaker** to call people to Allah. A mob attacked the believers, and **Utbah bin Rabi’ah** brutally beat Abu Bakr, sitting on his chest and pounding his face with hard-soled shoes until his nose was broken and he fell into a **coma**. 

When Abu Bakr regained consciousness a day later, his first question was, **"What happened to the Prophet?"**. He refused to eat or drink until he was taken to the Prophet (saw) at **Darul Arqam**. Upon seeing him safe, the Prophet was moved to tears. At Abu Bakr’s request, the Prophet (saw) made dua for his mother, **Ummu Khair**, who then accepted Islam.

### 5. Abdullah bin Mas’ud: The Knowledgeable Youth
**Abdullah bin Mas’ud** was a young shepherd who initially refused to give the Prophet (saw) and Abu Bakr milk from his employer’s herd because he was in a **position of trust**. The Prophet (saw) then touched a young she-camel that had not yet bred, and its udders **miraculously filled with milk**. After witnessing this and the udders receding upon the Prophet’s command, Abdullah asked to be taught "those beautiful words". The Prophet (saw) identified him as a **"knowledgeable young man"** even before his conversion. Abdullah went on to become one of the original **Hufadh**, memorising 70 surahs directly from the Prophet’s mouth.
