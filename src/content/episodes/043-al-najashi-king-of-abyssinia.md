### 1. The Court of al-Najashi and the Quraysh Deception
After the Muslims sought refuge in Abyssinia, the Quraysh sent a delegation to bribe the King’s ministers and gain an audience to demand their return. **Amr ibn al-'As** and **Umara** falsely claimed that 'foolish slaves' had run away from Makkah and should be handed over. However, the King, known for his **reputation for honesty**, refused to deport them without hearing both sides of the story. The Muslims, though worried about losing their low profile, appointed **Ja’far ibn Abi Talib**—the Prophet’s cousin—to represent them due to his **intelligence, eloquence, and calm nature**.

### 2. Ja’far’s Defence and the Refusal to Bow
When entering the court, Ja’far and the Muslims greeted the King but **did not bow**, which the Quraysh immediately pointed out as a sign of disrespect. Ja’far explained that they only prostrate to **Allah (swt)**. He described how the Prophet (saw) commanded them to pray, give charity, be good to their families, and **protect orphans**, while shunning oppression, stealing, and foul speech. When the Quraysh again claimed they were slaves, Ja’far amusedly refuted this by noting his own high lineage as the son of a tribal leader, and Amr was forced to admit he had no evidence for his claim.

### 3. The Recitation of Surat Maryam
On the second day of the hearing, Amr attempted a new tactic by claiming the Muslims said 'shocking things' about **Isa (as)**. When questioned, Ja’far recited verses from **Surat Maryam**, detailing the miraculous, chaste birth of Isa (as) and his proclamation as a Prophet and slave of Allah. The recitation was so moving that the King and his priests **wept until their beards were wet**. Al-Najashi declared that the message was not even a twig’s width different from what Isa (as) had taught and granted the Muslims **full freedom and protection** in his kingdom.

### 4. The Trials and Compassion of al-Najashi
The sources reveal that al-Najashi’s empathy stemmed from his own **traumatic childhood**. After his father died, his power-hungry uncle sold him into **slavery**. He eventually escaped, launched a civil war, and reclaimed his rightful throne. This background made him uniquely compassionate toward refugees. Though he faced internal opposition and further civil wars for his pro-Muslim stance, he remained a secret believer and even received **special prayers for victory** from the Prophet (saw).

### 5. Ummu Habiba and the Marriage Proposal
Among the migrants was **Ramlah bint Abu Sufyan** (Ummu Habiba), who suffered greatly after her husband became an abusive alcoholic and died in Abyssinia. To honour her and alleviate her hardship as a single mother, the Prophet (saw) sent a **marriage proposal** from Medina. Al-Najashi himself facilitated the marriage, providing a caravan, bodyguards, and the **mahr (dowry)** on behalf of the Prophet (saw).

### 6. The Remote Janaza and Legal Precedent
In the **9th year of Hijrah**, the Prophet (saw) received news of al-Najashi’s death. He gathered the Sahaba and performed **Salat al-Janaza al-Gha’ib** (funeral prayer in absentia). The sources note that the majority of scholars believe this is **not a general precedent** for anyone who dies elsewhere; rather, it was a unique gesture of respect for a ruler whose Islam was a secret and who would not have received proper **Islamic burial rites** in his own land.
