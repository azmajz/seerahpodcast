### 1. The Aftermath of Abyssinia and al-Najashi’s Secret
Following the failed mission to retrieve the Muslims, **Amr bin al-’As** returned to Makkah and withdrew from society. He was deeply affected by the fact that **al-Najashi**, a sophisticated king, was absolutely convinced of Muhammad’s (saw) Prophethood. This contemplation eventually led Amr to his own conversion. 

The sources reveal that al-Najashi managed his hostile court by keeping a **secret piece of paper** over his heart. On it, he wrote the Shahadah and his belief that **Isa (as) was divinely placed into Maryam’s womb** without being the son of God. When challenged by his court, he would place his hand over the paper and affirm his belief in "this," referring to the hidden text to preserve his imaan and his safety. The Prophet (saw) held such high regard for the people of Habesha that years later in Madinah, he insisted on **personally serving travellers** from that region to repay the honour they showed his companions.

### 2. Hamza ibn Abdul Mutallib: The Warrior’s Conversion
In the early part of the **5th year of Prophethood**, the Prophet’s uncle and milk-brother, **Hamza**, accepted Islam. Hamza was a highly respected, "cool" figure and a formidable fighter known for wielding **swords in both hands**. 

Returning from a hunting trip, Hamza was informed by a slave woman that **Abu Jahl** had viciously insulted the Prophet at Mount Safa. Enraged, Hamza marched to the Haram and **cracked Abu Jahl over the head with his bow**, causing him to bleed. When Abu Jahl mocked him for "leaving the religion," Hamza publicly declared, **"I have... I believe in what Muhammad believes"**. Although he initially had doubts and spent a restless night praying for guidance, the Prophet (saw) laid out the truth for him the next morning, cementing the **imaan in his heart**.

### 3. Umar ibn al-Khattab: The "Loose Cannon" Delegate
Three days after Hamza, **Umar ibn al-Khattab** accepted Islam, providing the Muslims with powerful "enforcers". Before Islam, Umar was a talented but **rowdy individual** who served as a diplomatic negotiator for the Quraysh. Though he was the nephew and protégé of Abu Jahl, his social gifts lacked proper containment without faith. Despite his outward hostility, Umar had **two profound "close brushes"** with Islam:

*   **The Speaking Sacrifice:** While hungover in a temple, Umar witnessed a goat being sacrificed to an idol. Suddenly, a voice emerged from the **dead animal's innards**, announcing that the time of Muhammad had arrived and it was time to return to the worship of one Allah.
*   **The Recitation at the Ka'bah:** Umar once secretly listened to the Prophet recite **Surat al-Haqqa**. When Umar thought to himself that the words were the work of a poet, the Prophet recited: *"These are not the words of a poet"*. When he then thought it must be the work of a soothsayer, the next verse responded: *"Similarly, this is not the word of a soothsayer"*. This encounter **spiritually broke** Umar’s stubbornness, leaving him completely bewildered.
