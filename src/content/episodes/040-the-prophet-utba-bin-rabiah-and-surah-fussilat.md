summary: This episode details a pivotal confrontation between the Prophet (saw) and **Utbah bin Rabi’ah**, a sophisticated leader of the Quraysh chosen for his intellect and worldliness. After the Prophet rejected offers of immense wealth and power, he recited verses from **Surat Fussilat**, which left Utbah terrified and dazed. Despite privately admitting the divine nature of the words, Utbah ultimately chose **social status over the truth**, leading the Quraysh to adopt a formal policy of violence that eventually necessitated the **migration to Abyssinia**.
highlights:
  - "Utbah bin Rabi’ah was chosen as the Quraysh's 'best mind' to determine if the Prophet was possessed or using magic."
  - "The Quraysh offered to make the Prophet the wealthiest man in Makkah and marry him to ten beautiful women if he ceased his preaching."
  - "The Prophet’s recitation of the 'thunderbolt' punishment from Surat Fussilat caused Utbah to physically cover the Prophet’s mouth in a panic."
  - "Abu Jahl performed 'damage control' by pressuring Utbah to publicly reject the Prophet to save his reputation."
  - "Utbah betrayed his own conviction, claiming he was merely recovering from 'powerful magic' to avoid the torture faced by other Muslims."
  - "Allah revealed verses in Surat Al-Muddaththir to console the Prophet and promise justice against Utbah’s arrogance."

### 1. The Delegation of Utbah bin Rabi’ah
The "brain trust" of the Quraysh met to discuss how to handle the Prophet (saw), whom they viewed as a troublemaker who had divided their community. They selected **Utbah bin Rabi’ah** to investigate whether the Prophet was suffering from jinn possession, mental instability, or magic. Utbah was uniquely qualified: he was a wealthy, politically influential leader who had traveled extensively and stood in the courts of the Emperor of Rome and the King of Abyssinia.

### 2. The Negotiation: Wealth, Women, and Power
Utbah approached the Prophet with **emotional blackmail**, asking if he considered himself better than his own idol-worshipping forefathers. He accused the Prophet of humiliating the Arabs and mocked his way of living. Attempting to buy his silence, Utbah presented an offer from the Quraysh:
*   **Wealth:** They created a fund to make him the **wealthiest man in Makkah**.
*   **Status:** They offered to marry him to **ten of the most beautiful women** in the city.
*   **Leadership:** They urged him to "stop this foolishness" in exchange for these worldly gains.

### 3. The Divine Response: Surat Fussilat
The Prophet remained silent throughout Utbah's offers, then asked, "Are you done?". Upon Utbah's confirmation, the Prophet recited the first 13 verses of **Surat Fussilat**. The verses described the Quran as a book laid out in detail for people to learn, but warned that those who turn away have "hearts covered in a seal". 

The recitation reached a terrifying climax when the Prophet mentioned the **Sa’iqatan**—a destructive force or thunderbolt—similar to the one that obliterated the ancient tribes of **A’ad and Thamud**. Utbah was so overcome with fear that he screamed, **"Please stop, please stop!"** and reached out to physically grab the Prophet’s mouth to silence him.

### 4. Utbah’s Internal Conflict and Abu Jahl’s Bribe
When Utbah returned to the Quraysh, his face was visibly changed. He admitted to them that **"what I heard from Muhammad was not of this earth"** and that it was unlike any poetry, magic, or soothsaying he had ever encountered. He warned his people that the Prophet never lied and that he had feared the sky would fall on him during the recitation.

Seeing that Utbah was "dazed" and potentially leaning toward belief, **Abu Jahl** intervened for "damage control". He insulted Utbah, suggesting the people thought he had forsaken his religion, and offered him a bribe of more money to publicly reject Muhammad. 

### 5. The Betrayal of Truth
Utbah was well aware of the cost of following the Prophet; he had witnessed the brutal torture of **Abu Bakr, Uthman, and the family of Yasir**. Unwilling to sacrifice his wealth and status, he made a public announcement designed to protect his reputation. He claimed he had merely been dazed by **"powerful magic"** and that he had overcome it because he was "genetically and intellectually superior" to the Prophet's other followers, whom he called "sheep".

### 6. Divine Consolation and the Turning Point
The Prophet was deeply hurt by this rejection, as he had seen the message penetrate Utbah’s heart. To console him, Allah revealed verses from **Surat Al-Muddaththir**, describing Utbah’s arrogance and his impending punishment in **Saqar** (a level of Hell).

This incident marked a dark transition in Makkah. The Quraysh realized that "alternative solutions" had been exhausted. From this point forward, **violence and aggression** became the publicly accepted policy of the Quraysh, leading the Muslims to eventually seek refuge by migrating to **Habesha (Abyssinia)**.
