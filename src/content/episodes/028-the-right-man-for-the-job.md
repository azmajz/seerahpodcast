summary: "This episode explores the **aftermath of the First Revelation**, detailing how the Prophet Muhammad (saw) was meticulously prepared for his role through **true dreams** and a deep-seated habit of **reflection**. It captures the intense emotional and psychological weight he felt after the encounter in the Cave of Hira, his initial **fears of failure**, and the critical reassurance provided by his wife **Khadijah** and the scholar **Waraqah bin Nawfal**. Finally, the sources detail the **five distinct forms** in which Divine Revelation was subsequently delivered to the Prophet throughout his mission."
highlights:
  - "The Prophet was divinely designated for his role before the soul of Adam (as) was even placed in his body."
  - "Six months of true dreams served to build his 'heart-trust' so he would recognise the first angelic encounter as reality."
  - "Prophethood is generally marked at age 40, though a 2-3 year silent period thereafter leads to minor scholarly debate on the exact start date."
  - "Fearing he might be associated with misguiding soothsayers, the Prophet initially felt a crushing burden of responsibility."
  - "Khadijah (ra) famously comforted him by citing his impeccable character: maintaining family ties, aiding the poor, and honoring guests."
  - "Waraqah bin Nawfal identified Jibril as the 'Namoos'—the same carrier of truth who visited Musa (as)."
  - "Divine Revelation was delivered in five forms, ranging from direct inspiration in the heart to the physically agonizing 'ringing of a bell'."

### 1. Divine Preparation and Character
The journey to Prophethood was not a random convergence of events; the Prophet (saw) was meticulously prepared for this role throughout his life. For six months prior to the first revelation, he received **true dreams** that materialised with precision, ensuring that when Jibril eventually appeared, he would **trust his heart** over any doubts that his mind was playing tricks. Although he was a caring family man who gave quality time to his community, he grew naturally inclined toward **isolation in the Cave of Hira**—a practice where "time spent alone is reality time spent with Allah".

### 2. The Encounter and the Psychological Burden
Following the command to "Read" and the intense three-fold embrace from Jibril intended to shed his apprehension, the Prophet (saw) was left grappling with the experience. He felt a **huge burden of responsibility** and feared that he might be associated with **misguiding poets and soothsayers**, whom he deeply disliked for preying on the insecure. This weight was so immense that he momentarily contemplated whether he could live up to the expectation or serve the message properly.

### 3. Comfort and Reassurance from Khadijah
When the Prophet (saw) returned home shaken, asking to be covered up (**"Zammiluni"**), Khadijah (ra) provided essential psychological support. She insisted that **Allah would never disgrace him** because of his virtuous actions: he maintained family relationships, carried the burdens of the people, took care of the less fortunate, and aided good causes. Her words had a profound **calming effect**, strengthening the Prophet through her unwavering belief in his character.

### 4. Waraqah bin Nawfal’s Prophecy
Khadijah (ra) took the Prophet (saw) to see her cousin **Waraqah bin Nawfal**, a blind scholar who was a practitioner of **Tawheed** and had studied the Tawrat and Injeel. Waraqah immediately recognised the account, identifying Jibril as the **Namoos** (carrier of truth) who had visited Musa (as). He warned the Prophet (saw) that he would be **opposed and eventually kicked out** of Makkah by his own people. Though the Prophet was shocked—believing his neighbors loved him—Waraqah confirmed that anyone who brought such a Message was always made an enemy. Waraqah passed away shortly after, but the Prophet (saw) later saw him in a dream **wearing silk in Paradise** for his belief.

### 5. The Five Forms of Revelation (Al-Wahi)
According to the sources, Divine Revelation was delivered to the Prophet in five specific ways:
*   **True Physical Form:** Jibril presenting himself as he truly is; the Prophet saw him this way twice, with **600 wings** covering the entire horizon.
*   **Human Form:** Jibril would appear as a human being to make the experience easier, often taking the form of a handsome Sahabi named **Dihya al-Kalbi**.
*   **Dreams:** Receiving the message while asleep.
*   **Direct Inspiration:** Allah's words being inspired directly into his heart from "behind the curtain".
*   **Ringing of a Bell:** The **harshest form**, where a continuous ringing would pierce his mind. This form was so heavy that if he were riding a camel, the animal would be forced to sit down. Even on cold days, the Prophet would **sweat profusely** from the intensity of the experience.
