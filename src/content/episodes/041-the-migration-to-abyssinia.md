summary: "This episode details the 5th year of Prophethood, when full-scale violence and aggression from the Quraysh forced the Prophet (saw) to prioritize the safety of the believers over community size. It explores the first and second waves of migration to Abyssinia, the noble example set by **Uthman ibn Affan and Ruqayyah**, and the miraculous moment in the Haram where even **Abu Jahl and the idolaters** were compelled to prostrate upon hearing the recitation of **Surat An-Najm**."
highlights:
  - "The Prophet acted as an empathetic leader, researching options and choosing Abyssinia due to King an-Najashi’s religious tolerance."
  - "Uthman ibn Affan revived the tradition of the Prophets by being the first since Lut (as) to migrate with his family for the sake of his faith."
  - "The first wave of 15–16 migrants narrowly escaped a Qurayshi search party by renting a boat at the port of Suhaiban."
  - "A public recitation of Surat An-Najm at the Ka'bah resulted in the entire Quraysh instinctively falling into sajdah (prostration) alongside the Prophet."
  - "The Quraysh leaders used 'sorcery' as a PR excuse to explain why they had bowed to the Prophet's words."
  - "The community in Abyssinia eventually grew to approximately 100 Muslims, consisting of both elite members and former slaves."

### 1. The Decision to Migrate
By the **5th year of Prophethood**, violence against Muslims became full-scale. The sources describe the Prophet (saw) as an **empathetic leader** who prioritized the security of his followers over maintaining large numbers in Makkah. After researching his options, he identified **Abyssinia (Habesha)** as a safe haven because its Christian King, **an-Najashi**, was well-known for his religious tolerance toward Jews, fire-worshippers, and idolaters.

### 2. The First Wave of Migrants
In the month of Rajab, a group of **15–16 people** (including four women) left Makkah under the cover of night. Key figures included:
*   **Uthman ibn Affan** and his wife **Ruqayyah** (the Prophet’s daughter).
*   **Zubayr ibn al-Awam, Mus’ab ibn Umair, and Abdur Rahman ibn Awf**.
*   **Abu Salama** and his wife **Ummu Salama**.

With limited funds and only 7–8 animals, they traveled to the port of **Suhaiban**, where they rented a boat just before a Qurayshi search party arrived to drag them back to Makkah.

### 3. The Virtue of Uthman ibn Affan
The Prophet (saw) expressed great relief upon hearing from a trader that the group had arrived safely. He noted that **Uthman had revived a great tradition**, being the first person since **Lut (as)** to leave his home with his family for the sake of his Imaan. The sources state this praise dispels later accusations by the Khawaarij that Uthman was a coward; rather, his migration was an act of **extreme nobility**.

### 4. The Incident of Surat An-Najm
During Ramadan of that same year, the Prophet (saw) recited **Surat An-Najm** out loud at the Haram. Although the Quraysh initially intended to stop him, they were **completely captivated** by the words. As he reached the final command to **\"prostrate to Allah and worship [Him]\"**, the entire crowd—including **Abu Jahl**—instinctively fell into sajdah. **Walid ibn Mughira**, unwilling to bow but still moved, placed a handful of dirt on his forehead instead. 

### 5. False Rumors and the Expansion
Word spread outside Makkah that the entire Quraysh had converted, leading **12 of the original migrants** to return home. Upon learning the truth just outside Makkah, some returned to Abyssinia while others entered the city secretly. However, once it was confirmed that Abyssinia was safe, dozens more Muslims migrated in small waves of 4–5 people to bypass border patrols. Eventually, a community of **82-83 men and 16 women** emerged in Abyssinia.

### 6. Lessons in Leadership and Conduct
The sources highlight several key leadership lessons from the Prophet (saw):
*   **Preparation:** A leader must be well-researched and informed.
*   **Sacrifice:** He was willing to lose his numbers to ensure his followers' safety.
*   **Low Profile:** He advised the migrants to live slightly outside the major cities and **keep a low profile** to avoid becoming a point of contention.
*   **Respect:** The migrants understood they were guests and did not "act as though they owned the place," maintaining a respectful presence in their new home.
