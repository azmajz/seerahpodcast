summary: "This episode marks the most pivotal moment in Islamic history: **Badlul Wahi** (The Beginning of Revelation). After a **600-year silence** since the time of Isa (as), the doors of Divine communication were reopened to complete the final message for humanity. The narrative details the Prophet's (saw) spiritual and physical preparation through **true dreams** and isolation in the **Cave of Hira**, culminating in his intense first encounter with the Angel Jibril and the revelation of the first five verses of **Surat Al-Alaq**."
highlights:
  - "The first signs of revelation were 'true dreams' that materialised exactly as seen in the morning."
  - "The Prophet practiced *at-tahannuth* (seclusion) in the Cave of Hira to pull away from the corruption and shirk of his society."
  - "Angel Jibril embraced the Prophet three times with intense physical pressure to prepare him spiritually to receive the Divine Message."
  - "Umar ibn al-Khattab experienced a similar spiritual 'breaking in' through three distinct encounters with the truth before accepting Islam."
  - "The first revelation established that Islam is 'Haqq'—meaning it possesses a stable, firm foundation."

### 1. The Divine Buildup and the End of Silence
For over **six centuries**, the doors of Revelation had been closed. Their reopening was not merely a continuation but a **completion of guidance**; once these doors closed after Muhammad (saw), they would never be opened again. Prior to this, the Prophet (saw) lived a full, successful life as a businessman and family man, but his attention eventually turned toward the **spiritual decay** of his society. He had already been socially active through the *Hilf ul-Fudl* and the renovation of the Ka’bah, but he began to seek **isolation** to meditate on life's deeper meanings.

### 2. Preparation Through Dreams and *At-Tahannuth*
The Beginning of Revelation (*Badlul Wahi*) started with **true dreams** (*Ru'ya Sadiqah*). As narrated by Aisha (ra), these dreams would come true as clearly as the "morning light," teaching the Prophet to **trust his heart** and internal visions without doubt. 

To further prepare, he practiced **at-tahannuth** in the Cave of Hira during Ramadan. The term *at-tahannuth* implies a **departure or drawing away** from something—in this case, the corruption, shirk, and idol-worship of Makkah. This practice of isolation provided him with the peace and tranquility necessary to receive the Divine Message and is considered the origin of the Sunnah of ***i’tikaaf***.

### 3. The Encounter in the Cave of Hira
The Angel Jibril eventually appeared to Muhammad (saw) in the cave and commanded: **"Iqra" (Read/Recite)**. The Prophet, being unlettered and formally uneducated in reading and writing, replied, **"I am not a reader"**. In response, Jibril **tightly embraced and smothered** the Prophet until he lost all energy to resist, then released him to breathe. This happened **three times**. 

This physical interaction was a crucial part of his **spiritual preparation**. Scholars explain that spiritual growth often requires **physical pressure**; just as an athlete must push their body to reach peak performance, the Prophet’s *nafs* (self) needed to be "broken in" to accept the weight of the Revelation. After the third embrace and release, Jibril delivered the first verses of the Quran:
> *"Recite, in the name of your Lord who created. Created man out of a clot of congealed blood. Recite and your Lord is the most Generous. Who taught by the pen. Taught man that which he knew not"* (**Surat Al-Alaq, 96:1-5**).

### 4. The Concept of "Haqq" and Spiritual Foundation
The sources define **Haqq** (Truth) as something with a **stable, firm foundation**. By referring to the Quran and Islam as *Haqq*, Allah signifies that this message is built upon an unshakeable base. The physical and emotional pressure applied to the Prophet during the first revelation served to ensure he reached the **peak of his spiritual condition** to carry this foundation.

### 5. Parallel: The "Breaking In" of Umar ibn al-Khattab
The sources draw a parallel between the Prophet's experience and the conversion of **Umar ibn al-Khattab**, who also required a spiritual "breaking in" before accepting the truth. Umar faced the truth **three times** before his heart yielded:
1.  **The Miracle in the Monastery:** He heard a sacrificed goat recite the Shahadah while he was in a drunken stupor.
2.  **The Recitation at the Haram:** He overheard the Prophet reciting **Surat Al-Haqqah**. When Umar thought it was poetry or magic, the verses immediately refuted his thoughts, though he still walked away.
3.  **The Final Threshold:** He finally accepted Islam only after barging into his sister’s home to assassinate the Prophet, where reading the verses of **Surah Ta’ha** finally broke his resistance. 

Just as Jibril used physical pressure followed by "breathing room" to prepare the Prophet, Umar's journey involved **intense pressure followed by reflection** until he was ready to embrace the Message.
