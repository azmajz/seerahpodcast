### 1. The Protection of the Heavens
The sources describe Revelation as an "ocean without an end" that required strict protection. Before the Prophet's mission, **shayatin** (evil jinn) would eavesdrop on the angels to steal news of Allah's will for soothsayers. As Prophethood approached, angels began **hurling fireballs and rocks** from the heavens to drive them out. Iblis recognized this shift and sent his followers to investigate, eventually discovering the cause when he saw the Prophet coming from the **Cave of Hira** with Jibril in the sky.

### 2. The Physical and Emotional Toll
The delivery of Divine Revelation was an incredibly **heavy and burdensome** experience for the Prophet. Even on chilly nights, he would **sweat profusely**, with droplets falling like "pearl beads" from his face. Those nearby could often hear a sound similar to the **buzzing of bees** around him. Despite this intensity, the Prophet remained conscious; on one occasion, he continued holding a bone with meat on it during a revelation, demonstrating that he did not lose control of his body.

### 3. Impact on Witnesses and Animals
The sheer weight of the "heavy word" was physically felt by his surroundings.
*   **The Sahaba:** During the revelation of verses from **Surat An-Nisa**, the Prophet's knee was resting on the knee of **Zayd ibn Thabit**, who described feeling as though his **leg was being crushed** by the immense pressure.
*   **The She-camel:** When **Surat Al-Ma’idah** was revealed while the Prophet was riding his camel, Asba, the weight was so great the **animal could not move**, prompting the Prophet to dismount out of mercy.

### 4. Memorisation and the Divine Guarantee
Early in his mission, the Prophet would **move his tongue rapidly** to repeat verses as Jibril recited them, fearing he might forget the message. Allah reassured him in **Surat Al-Qiyamah**, stating that it was **Allah's sole responsibility** to compile the Quran in his heart and clarify its meaning. This divine guarantee ensured that the Prophet became the **first hafidh**, able to recite and transcribe the verses perfectly once the revelation was complete.

### 5. Compassion and Relationship with the Sahaba
The sources emphasize the Prophet's **deep compassion**; even when facing the "pangs of death" (*sakarat ul-maut*), he asked Allah to give him the full pain but **spare his ummah** from it. He maintained a humble and "down to earth" relationship with the Sahaba, who were so comfortable with him that they would sometimes **yell for him** from outside his house. This necessitated divine intervention, where Allah reminded the Sahaba **not to overstep boundaries** or take advantage of the Prophet’s kind and shy nature.
