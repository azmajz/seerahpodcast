### 1. The Prophet's Humanity and the Purpose of the Qur'an
The sources emphasise that while the Prophet (saw) was a remarkable human being, he was not a "superhero" unaffected by pain or unhappiness. He experienced **difficulties and exhaustion** after three years of isolation in the valley of Abu Talib. To help him navigate the resumed confrontations in Makkah, the Qur’an acted as a **source of consolation and guidance**. Surahs like **Surat Yasin** and **Surat Ta’ha** were explicitly revealed to reassure him that he was on a straight path and that the message was not sent to cause him distress.

### 2. Guarding the Tongue: Surat al-An’am
Upon his return to the Ka’bah, **Abu Jahl** resumed his hostility, threatening to curse what the Muslims worshipped if they did not stop speaking against idols. In response, Allah revealed **Surat al-An’am (6:108)**, advising the Prophet and the Ummah **not to insult those they invoke other than Allah**. This was a strategic guidance to prevent the idolaters from insulting Allah out of ignorance and vengeance.

### 3. Intellectual Warfare and Nadr ibn al-Hadith
**Nadr ibn al-Hadith**, a key leader of the opposition, sought to make the Prophet look like a fool by telling war stories and claiming the Prophet was merely reciting **"legends of former peoples"**. To console the Prophet, Allah revealed verses in **Surat al-Furqan**, affirming the divine nature of the revelation and describing the idols as created beings that possess no power over life or death.

### 4. The Debate Over Idols and Righteous Figures
When the Prophet recited verses from **Surat Al-Anbiya** stating that idols and their worshippers would be the **"firewood of Hell,"** the Quraysh attempted a logical trap. They asked if this meant **Isa (as)** and the angels would also burn, as they were also worshipped by some. The Prophet clarified that only those who **claimed to be deities** or the false idols themselves would burn; those for whom a "best reward" had preceded, like Isa (as), would be far removed from the fire.

### 5. Challenges to Resurrection and Status
The sources detail several instances where the Quraysh leaders mocked Islamic tenets:
*   **The Decomposed Bones:** Leaders like Akhmash bin Suraikh and Abu Jahl crushed old bones in front of the Prophet, mocking the idea of resurrection. **Surat Yasin** responded that He who produced them the first time is easily able to give them life again.
*   **The "Great Man" Argument:** Walid bin Mughira questioned why the Quran was not sent to "great men" (wealthy leaders) like himself. **Surat Az-Zukhruf** corrected this by stating that Allah distributes His mercy as He wills, and His mercy is better than accumulated wealth.
*   **The Ridiculous Compromise:** The Quraysh offered a partnership where they would worship Allah if the Prophet worshipped their idols. This led to the revelation of **Surat Al-Kafirun**, establishing a clear separation in faith.

### 6. Lessons in Attention: Abdullah bin Umm Maktum
One notable moment involved **Abdullah bin Umm Maktum**, a poor blind man who interrupted a polite conversation between the Prophet and Walid bin Mughira. Hoping Walid might convert, the Prophet **frowned and turned away** from Abdullah. Allah immediately sent verses from **Surat Abasa**, reminding the Prophet that the one striving for knowledge while fearing Allah is more deserving of attention than the arrogant man who thinks himself without need. This reinforced the Quran's role as a tool for **spiritual tranquility and navigating difficult social dynamics**.
