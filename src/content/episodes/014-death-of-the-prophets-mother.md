### 1. The Character of Aminah and Early Formative Years
After Muhammad (saw) was returned to his mother at age four and a half, he experienced a typical childhood, learning essential skills like dressing and feeding himself. Aminah was not an ordinary mother; she was **exceptionally intelligent**, gifted in poetry, and well-versed in the history of her people. As a woman of **high regard**, her cultured and sophisticated nature directly contributed to the Prophet’s early upbringing. The sources note that every individual who had a major influence on him during these years possessed **great conduct and high morals**. This included his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, the leader of the Quraysh, who famously refused to use his leadership connections for **financial gain**.

### 2. The Journey to Yathrib and Childhood Memories
When Muhammad (saw) was six, Aminah decided to travel 300 kilometres from Makkah to Yathrib to visit her late husband Abdullah's grave and introduce her son to extended relatives in **Quba**. Accompanied by the faithful **Ummu Ayman**, they stayed for about a month. Decades later, during the Madinan period, the Prophet (saw) was able to point out the specific house where they stayed, the pond where he **learned to swim**, and the field where he played with other children. These memories highlights the **relatable, human childhood** of the Messenger of Allah.

### 3. Prophecies and the Recognition of Ahmad
During the stay in Yathrib, Ummu Ayman recalled an incident where two Jewish men approached them asking to see a child named **Ahmad**, a name Aminah fondly used for her son. Upon inspecting the child, they found the **Seal of Prophethood** on his back and declared him the "Prophet of our times". They predicted that Yathrib would be his place of migration (**Dar-ul-Hijra**) and that great battles would eventually revolve around him. This revelation **frightened Aminah** for her son's safety, prompting her to pack her bags and leave immediately.

### 4. The Passing at Abua and Return to Makkah
On the return journey to Makkah, Aminah’s health worsened, and she passed away in the small town of **Abua**. This followed a pattern of tragic travel-related deaths in the family, including his great-grandfather Hashim and his father Abdullah. **Ummu Ayman** buried Aminah and either returned to Yathrib for help or brought the young boy back to Makkah herself. At only six years old, Muhammad (saw) was placed back into the care of his grandfather, **Abdul Muttalib**.

### 5. Evolution of Islamic Legislation
The sources explain that several practices in Islam, such as **visiting graves**, were initially forbidden to help the companions break bad habits or secure their **Tawhid**. Just as the use of certain containers associated with alcohol was temporarily banned, visiting graves was restricted to prevent any association with grave-worshipping. Once the Sahaba had become **solid in their imaan**, the Prophet (saw) made these acts permissible again, stating: *"I used to tell you not to visit graves, go ahead and visit them now"*.

### 6. The Prophet’s Humanity and Emotional Fortitude
Fifty years after his mother's death, the Prophet (saw) visited her grave at Abua and **cried so profusely** that he choked up and caused his companions to weep with him. When Umar (ra) asked what made him so sad, he explained he had visited the grave of Aminah bint Wahb. This moment serves as a powerful reminder that the Prophet (saw), despite his divine role, remained a **human being** in touch with his emotions. The sources emphasize that becoming spiritual or pious does not mean becoming **heartless**; rather, it is important for carriers of the deen to remain relatable and emotionally open.
