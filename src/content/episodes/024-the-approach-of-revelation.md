It details the Prophet’s (saw) increasing habit of seclusion and meditation in the **Cave of Hira**, the celestial signs observed by soothsayers, and the specific prophecies held by the **Ahl al-Kitab** (People of the Book). The narrative features the profound journeys of individuals like **Abu Hayaban** and **Salman al-Farsi**, who dedicated their lives to finding the final Messenger based on signs recorded in ancient scriptures."

  - "The name 'Ahmad' was used by Isa (as) to prophesy the Prophet's coming and was the name used fondly by his mother Aminah."
  - "Celestial activity increased as revelation approached, with angels launching shooting stars to prevent jinn from eavesdropping on the Heavens."
  - "Salman al-Farsi searched for decades, transitioning from fire-worship to Christianity before being sold into slavery in Madinah to find the Prophet."
  - "The Prophet identified three signs for Salman: he does not eat charity (sadaqah), he accepts gifts, and he carries the Seal of Prophethood between his shoulders."

### 1. The Six-Century Silent Period and At-Tahannut
Before the arrival of Muhammad (saw), more than **six centuries** had passed since the world last received guidance through a Prophet (Isa as). This long period of spiritual darkness is alluded to in **Surat Ya-Sin**, describing a people whose forefathers had not been warned and were thus heedless. Two years prior to receiving his first revelation, Muhammad (saw) developed a habit of retreating to the **Cave of Hira** for meditation (**at-tahannut**). These retreats grew from hours to weeks; **Khadijah** would supporting him by packing provisions and bringing them to him when they ran out.

### 2. Prophecies in the Tawrat and Injeel
The sources emphasize that the coming of the "unlettered Prophet" was clearly mentioned in the **Tawrat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel)**. Isa (as) specifically gave the "good news" of a Messenger to follow him named **Ahmad**. This name was used affectionately by the Prophet's mother, **Aminah**, and his milk-mother, **Ummu Aymen**. Additionally, the ancient scriptures contained descriptions of the Prophet's companions—described as merciful among themselves and marked by the traces of prostration—and a **covenant** taken from all previous Prophets to support him.

### 3. Signs in the Heavens and the Jinn
As the "day of Iqra" approached, the spiritual world experienced significant shifts. Traditionally, **shayatin (bad jinn)** would eavesdrop on the angels in the Heavens to bring snippets of information to **soothsayers** on earth. However, as revelation drew near, this information flow was cut off. **Astrologers** observed an increase in **shooting stars**, which were launched by angels to drive the jinn away from the Heavens to protect the coming Message.

### 4. Scholars in Waiting: Abu Hayaban and Yushaa
A few scholarly members of the *Ahl al-Kitab* recognized these signs, though they were often on the fringe of society. 
*   **Abu Hayaban:** A Jewish scholar from Syria who moved to the harsh desert of **Yathrib** (Madinah) specifically because the scriptures stated the final Prophet would migrate there. On his deathbed, he urged his people to follow the Prophet when he arrived.
*   **Yushaa:** A Jewish neighbor in Yathrib who correctly predicted to a young **Salmat us-Salaama** that a Prophet would appear from Makkah. However, when the Prophet finally arrived, Yushaa refused to believe in him out of **jealousy and rebellion** because the Messenger was an Arab rather than a Jew.

### 5. The Quest of Salman al-Farsi
The sources provide a detailed account of **Salman al-Farsi’s** lifelong search for the truth. Originally a devoted fire-worshipper in Persia, he was drawn to **Christianity** after witnessing people praying in a monastery. He traveled through Syria, studying under a series of pious priests. The final priest on his deathbed told Salman that the **Prophet of the Last Times** was about to appear in the **Hijaaz** and gave him three identifying signs:
1.  He will **not eat from charity** (*sadaqah*).
2.  He will **accept and eat gifts**.
3.  He carries the **Seal of Prophethood** between his shoulder blades.

After being unjustly **sold into slavery** and brought to Madinah, Salman eventually met the Prophet in **Quba**. He tested the Prophet by offering him fruit as *sadaqah* (which the Prophet gave away) and then as a gift (which the Prophet ate). Finally, the Prophet allowed Salman to see the **Seal of Prophethood** on his back, leading Salman to embrace him in tears and accept Islam after decades of searching.
