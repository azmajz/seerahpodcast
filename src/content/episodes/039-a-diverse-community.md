summary: "This episode highlights the expanding reach of Islam beyond the Quraysh, focusing on the conversion of **Abu Dharr al-Ghifari** from the tribe of Ghifar and **Dhimad Azdi** from Yemen. It explores themes of **individual conviction**, the Prophet’s (saw) emphasis on **good character (akhlaq)**, and the strategic importance of tribal relations in Makkah. The narrative also provides a deep look into Abu Dharr's **ascetic philosophy** and his eventual retirement outside Medina during the khilafah of Uthman (ra)."
highlights:
  - "Abu Dharr al-Ghifari sent his brother to Makkah to investigate the Prophet’s message of good character before travelling there himself."
  - "Ali bin Abi Talib (ra) provided Abu Dharr with hospitality and used a 'game plan' to safely lead him to the Prophet (saw)."
  - "Abu Dharr was brutally beaten in the Haram after twice publicly proclaiming his faith; he was saved by the Prophet's uncle, Abbas."
  - "Abbas used economic leverage, reminding the Quraysh that their trade route to Syria ran through Abu Dharr’s tribe."
  - "Abu Dharr lived a strict minimalist life, viewing any wealth beyond bare necessities as a 'spiritual liability'."
  - "Dhimad Azdi, a professional 'jinn-buster,' converted instantly after hearing the Prophet’s (saw) powerful opening words."
  - "The tribe of Dhimad was treated with such respect by later Sahaba that even a small borrowed water container was returned out of honour for his pledge."

### 1. The Quest of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari
Abu Dharr, a successful businessman from the tribe of Ghifar, sought the truth after his brother reported that the Prophet (saw) taught **powerful messages regarding good conduct and character**. Arriving in Makkah without provisions, he hid his intentions due to the ongoing persecution. A young **Ali bin Abi Talib**, observing he was an out-of-towner, hosted him for three nights before Abu Dharr revealed his search. Ali devised a plan to lead him to the Prophet, using a code—pretending to look for water—if any danger appeared. After listening to the Prophet, Abu Dharr accepted Islam immediately.

### 2. The Bold Proclamation and Tribal Leverage
Despite being told to return home and wait for word, Abu Dharr’s **confidence and conviction** led him to the middle of the Haram, where he yelled the **Shahadah**. The Makkans responded with a brutal beating. He was saved by **Abbas**, the Prophet’s uncle, who used his "boombox" voice and physical presence to shield him. Abbas smartly reminded the crowd that killing Abu Dharr would **destroy their business**, as the tribe of Ghifar controlled their trade route to Bilad as-Sham. Abu Dharr repeated this bold proclamation the very next day, requiring Abbas to intervene again.

### 3. A Philosophy of Minimalism
Abu Dharr became known for a **strict ascetic lifestyle** based on a hadith stating that a person truly owns only the food they eat, the clothes they wear until they tatter, and the money given to charity. He viewed any excess wealth as a **spiritual liability** for which he would be questioned on the Day of Judgment. 
*   **Charity:** He famously insisted on giving the **best of his possessions** to the poor, once reprimanding a student for donating a weak camel instead of his strongest one.
*   **Conflict in Medina:** In his old age, as wealth poured into Medina, Abu Dharr openly criticised the new luxuries of the community. **Uthman (ra)** eventually suggested he retire to the outskirts of Medina to find peace of mind and maintain community harmony.

### 4. Dhimad Azdi: From Exorcist to Believer
Dhimad Azdi, a well-known **jinn-buster (exorcist)** from Yemen, came to Makkah intending to "diagnose" the Prophet after hearing children call him "crazy". However, when the Prophet (saw) began with the *Khutbatul Hajah* (praising Allah and testifying to His uniqueness), Dhimad was so moved he asked for it to be **repeated three times**. Declaring the words superior to those of soothsayers, magicians, or poets, he took the pledge of Islam and promised to convert his entire tribe.

### 5. Legacy and Honor
The impact of these early converts remained long after. Years later, a group of Sahaba returned a small **water container** they had taken for convenience once they realised they were in the territory of **Dhimad’s tribe**. Their leader insisted on this out of respect for the **sincerity and loyalty** Dhimad had shown when he first pledged himself to the Prophet (saw).
