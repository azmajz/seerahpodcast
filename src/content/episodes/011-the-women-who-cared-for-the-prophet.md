### 1. Spiritual Milestones and the Distress of Shaytan
According to the sources, there are several specific occasions in history when **Shaytan wailed and cried miserably**, marking significant spiritual shifts. These include when he was **cursed by Allah**, when he was **cast down to the earth**, the day of the **Prophet’s birth**, the day he was given **Prophethood (Nabu’a)**, the revelation of **Surat Al-Fatiha**, and finally during the **conquest of Makkah**. These events represent the triumph of divine guidance over evil.

### 2. The Legal and Social Boundaries of Nursing
The sources explain that Islam established clear boundaries regarding **milk-mothers** in *Surat An-Nisa* (4:23). When a woman nurses a child, it establishes relations similar to **blood relations**; the child cannot marry the nursing woman or her children. While this does not establish biological rights like **inheritance**, it creates a *sacred bond* of motherhood. The Prophet (saw) strictly adhered to these boundaries, notably refusing a proposal to marry the daughter of **Abu Salima** because she was his **milk-niece**, as both he and her father had been nursed by **Thuwayba**.

### 3. Ummu Ayman (Baraqah): A Mother Beyond Blood
**Baraqah**, known as **Ummu Ayman**, was a *Habeshi woman* from East Africa originally owned by Abdul Muttalib and then inherited by the Prophet. After freeing her, the Prophet (saw) maintained an incredibly close relationship with her, calling her **\"Ya Umm\" (O Mother)** and stating, **\"She is all that is left of my family\"**. She was an early Muslim who participated in the **Hijra to Habesha** and later joined the Prophet in battles to **serve water and tend the injured**. After the Prophet's passing, she wept not just out of grief, but because the era of **divine Revelation (Wahi)** had come to an end.

### 4. The Miracles and Legacy of Ummu Ayman
During her **Hijra on foot**, while fasting and without provisions, Ummu Ayman became so thirsty she feared for her life. In a **miraculous event**, a bucket of water *literally descended from the sky*; after drinking it, she **never felt thirsty again** for the rest of her life. She later married **Zayd ibn Haritha**, and their son **Usama ibn Zayd** was known as the **\"Beloved of the Prophet\" (Hibbu Rasulillah)**. The Prophet expressed immense love and **compassion** for this family, often praying for Allah to look after them.

### 5. Zayd ibn Haritha: Loyalty and Adoption
**Zayd ibn Haritha** was kidnapped as a child and eventually given to the Prophet as a wedding gift by **Khadijah**. When his biological father, **Haritha**, eventually tracked him down and offered to buy his freedom, Zayd chose to stay with the Prophet because of the **familial love and respect** he had received. The Prophet then **adopted him**, and though the practice of changing one's lineage (e.g., calling him Zayd ibn Muhammad) was later **forbidden**, Zayd remained closely affiliated with the Prophet as **\"Zayd mowla Rasulillah\"**.

### 6. Thuwayba and the Overjoyed Abu Lahab
**Thuwayba** was a slave girl owned by **Abu Lahab** and the first woman to nurse the Prophet after Aminah. When she brought news of the Prophet’s birth, Abu Lahab was so **overjoyed** that he freed her on the spot. Because she also nursed **Hamza**, the Prophet’s uncle became his **milk-brother**. Even after his death as an enemy of Islam, Abu Lahab was seen in a dream by his brother **Abbas**, claiming he received a **reprieve from punishment every Monday** because he had shown respect by freeing Thuwayba on the day of the Prophet's birth.
