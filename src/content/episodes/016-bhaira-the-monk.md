### 1. The Emotional Attachment and the Journey to As-Sham
After the death of his grandfather, the eight-year-old Muhammad (saw) came under the **extremely caring guardianship** of his uncle, Abu Talib. When Abu Talib prepared for a business trip to **As-Sham** (modern-day Syria), the young Muhammad, who had lost his mother and grandfather in quick succession, became **deeply distressed and cried profusely**. Although travel was dangerous and it was uncommon to take children on such long journeys, Abu Talib was so moved by his nephew's grief that he **vowed never to leave him**. This early experience solidified a bond that would later see Abu Talib **vehemently defend** the Prophet during his mission, even though the uncle never personally accepted Islam.

### 2. Bahira: The Reclusive Scholar of Busra
The business caravan eventually reached **Busra**, a small village on the outskirts of Syria that served as a rest stop for Qurayshi travellers. Overlooking this stop was a monastery occupied by **Buhayra ar-Rahib** (also known as Sergius), a reclusive Christian monk and academic. This monastery functioned as a **research centre** and housed a library of **ancient sacred texts** that were unique within the Christian kingdom at that time. Bahira was known for being **unsociable** and typically avoided interacting with the idol-worshipping Arab caravans that stopped nearby.

### 3. Miraculous Signs and Nature's Submission
While sitting in his monastery, Bahira observed the arrival of the Makkans and noticed something **extraordinary**: a **cloud was moving in perfect synchronisation** with the caravan, casting a shadow specifically over a couple of individuals. When the caravan stopped, the cloud stopped as well. Bahira then watched as the young Muhammad sat down on the side of a tree that had no shade. In a remarkable display of **divine intervention**, the **branches of the tree literally bent** to provide shade for the boy. Blown away by these sights, Bahira rushed to his manuscripts to refresh his knowledge of the **descriptions of the Final Prophet**.

### 4. The Feast and the Identification of the Prophet
Bahira broke his usual reclusive habit and invited the entire Quraysh caravan to a **large feast**. Initially, the Makkans left Muhammad behind to guard the animals and supplies, considering him **\"nobody important\"** due to his age. However, Bahira insisted that **everyone** must attend, and Muhammad was eventually fetched. Throughout the meal, the monk **stared intently** at the boy, observing his facial features and mannerisms. Bahira showed great affection to Muhammad, served him more food, and asked him detailed questions about his **sleep, thoughts, and habits**. Upon noticing the **Seal of Prophethood** on the boy's back, Bahira became **fully convinced** that this was the Final Nabi.

### 5. The Grave Warning and the Return to Makkah
Bahira questioned Abu Talib about his relationship with the boy, initially disbelieving when Abu Talib called Muhammad his son. Once Abu Talib clarified that he was his **brother's son** and that the father had died before birth, Bahira confirmed this matched the prophecies. He then issued a **stern warning**: Abu Talib should not take the child further into As-Sham, as people there would recognise the signs and might have **ill-will or seek to harm him**. Consequently, Abu Talib decided the safest course was to **return Muhammad to Makkah** immediately.

### 6. Early Character and Lifelong Foundations
It is reported that during this journey, Muhammad was in the company of other young boys who would become central figures in his life: **Abu Bakr and Bilal**. These three bonded during the trip, forming a connection that lasted into the era of Prophethood. Even in his adolescence, the Prophet was known as **Al-Sadiq Al-Amin** (The Truthful, The Trustworthy), and merchants trusted him to handle business matters from a young age. He displayed **exemplary character**, possessing a **natural aversion** to inappropriate talk or the useless activities that typical young men of the time engaged in.
