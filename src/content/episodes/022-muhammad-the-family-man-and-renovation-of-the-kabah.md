### 1. The Family Man: The Investment in Domestic Life
From the age of 25 to 35, the sources note that there were few major public events because the Prophet (saw) was **heavily invested in his family life**. During this decade, he built a life with Khadijah, and the majority of their children were born. The Prophet taught that **being a responsible husband and father** was his primary engagement, famously declaring that "the best amongst you is the one who is the best to his family". This period established his credibility as a **role model**; to provide marriage and parenting advice later, he first had to be the best practitioner of those roles.

### 2. Principles of an Islamic Household
The Prophet’s domestic life was characterised by **sharing quiet, private time with one's spouse** and integrating spirituality into family activities.
*   **Intimacy and Affection:** He mentioned the importance of intimately feeding one’s wife with one's own hands and eating together. 
*   **Physical Intimacy:** The sources state the Prophet specifically instructed that **physical intimacy with one’s spouse should not be treated like a chore** or like "going to the restroom" to merely relieve a need. Instead, he adamantly recommended that spouses **engage wholeheartedly**, putting in time and energy, and specifically encouraged **foreplay** rather than just intercourse.
*   **Family Worship:** He taught that worship (**ibadah**) does not require departing from the family; he would wake his own family for **Qiyam ul-Layl** (night prayers) and pray Sunnah prayers at home to lead by example.
*   **Education:** He was directly involved in his children's upbringing, such as teaching the **Tasbih of Fatimah** to his daughter and instructing his grandsons, Hasan and Husayn, in their deen.

### 3. Redefining Success and Community
The sources address a modern rhetoric that views time invested in family as "unproductive" compared to career or community work. In the Islamic perspective, being **family-oriented is a superior investment** because a healthy community is simply a network of healthy families. Historically, this was reflected in how scholars functioned; for the first 18–20 generations, the **majority of Hadith narrators** learned from their own parents or grandparents, as knowledge was distributed within the family first.

### 4. The Renovation of the Ka’bah
When the Prophet was 35, the Quraysh decided to renovate the Ka’bah, which had eroded due to **heavy rainstorms and floods**, and had been looted by thieves. The tribes were initially **terrified to tear it down**, fearing punishment from their idols. After the Prophet's great-uncle removed a stone and it **miraculously flew back** into its place, the Quraysh realised they had to proceed with extreme caution.

### 5. The Requirement of Pure (Halal) Wealth
The sign of the flying stone, followed by a **giant serpent** with a black body and white underbelly that hissed at workers, led to a pivotal decision: the Quraysh pledged to use **only pure wealth** for the reconstruction. They strictly forbade any money from **prostitution, wine, usury (interest), or gambling**. The sources highlight that if idol-worshippers understood that **haram income** lacked blessing (*barakah*) for a religious cause, modern Muslims should be even more mindful of the purity of their donations.

### 6. Tribal Conflict and Demolition
A dispute nearly led to war as families took **blood oaths** to claim the honour of the renovation. **Walid bin Mughira** resolved this by assigning each family a specific portion of the wall to reconstruct. After a day of hesitation where tribes made excuses to avoid starting, Walid took a hammer and began the demolition himself, praying that no offence was intended. When he remained healthy the next morning, the other tribes finally felt safe to participate.

### 7. The Foundation of Ibrahim (as)
Upon reaching the base, the workers found the **original foundation of Ibrahim (as)**, which consisted of jagged, **green-coloured rocks**. When a man tried to pry one of these rocks loose with an iron rod, a **warning earthquake** shook all of Makkah. Realising the foundation was sacred and laid by their forefather, the Quraysh decided to **leave it undisturbed** and built the new structure directly on top of it.
