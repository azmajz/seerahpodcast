  - "Abdul Muttalib was originally named Shaybah ('old man') due to a patch of white hair he had at birth."
  - "The name 'Abdul Muttalib' (Slave of Muttalib) originated from a misunderstanding by Makkans who thought his uncle had purchased a slave boy."
  - "Abdullah's life was spared from a sacrificial oath after 100 camels were slaughtered in his place as blood money."
  - "Prophet Muhammad (saw) identified himself as the 'son of the two sacrifices,' referring to Ismail (as) and his father Abdullah."
  - "The Prophet’s worldly inheritance from his father was modest, consisting of five camels, a small flock of goats, and a servant named Barakah."
  - "Scholars generally agree that the spiritual fate of the Prophet's parents is a matter known only to Allah and does not affect a believer's faith."

### 1. Hashim: The Architect of Makkan Hospitality and Economy
**Hashim**, whose birth name was *Amr*, was the Prophet’s great-grandfather and a highly respected leader of the **Banu Abd Munaf**. He is credited with instituting the **winter and summer business caravans**, which made the Makkan economy viable. Hashim was famous for his extreme generosity; he personally prepared **tharid** (crushed bread in broth) for pilgrims, earning him the nickname *Hashim* ("the pulverizer") because he **crushed the bread** with his own hands. During his travels to Syria, he married **Salma bint Amr** in Yathrib, but he tragically died in **Gaza** before their son was born.

### 2. The Rise of Abdul Muttalib: From Orphan to Leader
**Shaybah**, the Prophet's grandfather, grew up in Yathrib with his mother **Salma** and was named for the **white hair** he was born with. His uncle **Al-Muttalib** eventually brought him to Makkah to claim his birthright, though Makkans mistakenly called him **Abdul Muttalib** (Slave of Muttalib), a name that stuck. After his uncle died, Abdul Muttalib had to defend his inheritance from a younger uncle, **Nowfaal**, who attempted to usurp his wealth. With the military support of his maternal uncles from Yathrib, Abdul Muttalib successfully **restored his property** and responsibilities, eventually becoming the **unquestioned leader of Arabia**.

### 3. The Vow and the Sacrifice of One Hundred Camels
While digging the **Well of Zamzam**, Abdul Muttalib vowed that if Allah blessed him with **ten sons**, he would sacrifice one for His sake. When the time came to fulfil the oath, the lot fell upon his most beloved son, **Abdullah**. To save his son's life, Abdul Muttalib followed the advice of a soothsayer and **drew straws** between Abdullah and ten camels, increasing the number of camels until the lot finally fell on the animals. In total, **one hundred camels** were sacrificed—a massive financial sum likened to *driving 100 Mercedes off a cliff*—establishing a new precedent for **blood money** in Arabia that Islam later upheld.

### 4. Abdullah and Aminah: The Flower of Makkah
**Abdullah** was known as the *prince of Makkah*, admired for his handsomeness, gift of speech, and intelligence. He married **Aminah bint Wahab**, who was famously known as the **\"Flower of Makkah\"**. Shortly after their marriage, Abdullah was sent on business to Yathrib, where he **fell ill and died** at the age of twenty-five. Aminah, pregnant at the time, mourned her husband with **eloquent poetry**, describing how the earth had become *lonely* without the son of Hashim. At his death, Abdullah's humble estate included five camels, some goats, and a servant named **Barakah** (Ummu Ayman).

### 5. The Question of the Prophet's Parents' Salvation
The majority of Islamic scholars maintain that the **spiritual status** of the Prophet's parents is a matter that **does not affect one's faith** or daily practice. Minority views exist: one suggests they are not believers based on certain narrations of the Prophet crying at his mother's grave, while another argues they were **Hunafa** (monotheists) or part of the **People of Fatra**. This refers to people who lived during an extended period between messengers when no guidance was available. Ultimately, it is believed Allah will **test these individuals** on the Day of Judgment, as He does not wrong anyone.
